abstract: Abstract Compound semiconductors derived from ZnS (zincblende and wurtzite)
  with tetrahedral framework structures have functions for various applications. Examples
  of such materials include Cu--S-based materials with zincblende-derivative structures,
  which have attracted attention as thermoelectric (TE) materials over the past decade.
  This study illuminates superior TE performance in polycrystalline samples of enargite
  Cu$_3$ P$_{1-x}$ Ge$_x$ S$_4$ with a wurtzite-derivative structure. The substitution of Ge for P
  dopes holes into the top of the valence band composed of Cu-3d and S-3p, whereby
  its multiband characteristic leads to a high TE power factor. Furthermore, a reduction
  in the grain size to 50?300 nm can effectively decrease phonon mean free paths,
  leading to low thermal conductivity. These features result in a dimensionless TE
  figure of merit ZT of 0.5 at 673 K for the x = 0.2 sample. Environmentally benign
  and low-cost characteristics of the constituent elements of Cu3PS4, as well as its
  high-performance thermoelectricity, make it a promising candidate for large-scale
  TE applications. Furthermore, this finding extends the development field of Cu--S-based
  TE materials to those with wurtzite-derivative structures.
