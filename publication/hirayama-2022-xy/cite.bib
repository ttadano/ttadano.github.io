 abstract = {We propose silver-based oxides with layered perovskite
structure as candidates of exhibiting intriguing feature of
strongly correlated electrons. The compounds show unique
covalence between Ag d and O p orbitals with the strong
electron correlation of their antibonding orbital similar to
the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors, but
stronger covalency and slightly smaller correlation
strength. We examine $A_2$AgO$_2X_2$ with $A$ =Sr and Ba and
$X$ =F, I and Cl in detail. Among them, Sr$_2$AgO$_2$F$_2$
has the largest effective onsite Coulomb repulsion and shows
an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state, which competes
with correlated metals. It offers features both similar and
distinct from the copper oxides, and paves a new route. The
possibility of superconductivity in doped systems is
discussed.},
