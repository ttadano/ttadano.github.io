 abstract = {Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the
Sr-doped layered nickelate NdNiO2, we perform a systematic
computational materials design of layered nickelates that are
dynamically stable and whose electronic structure better mimics
the electronic structure of high-Tc cuprates than NdNiO2. While
the Ni 3d orbitals are self-doped from the d9 configuration in
NdNiO2 and the Nd-layer states form Fermi pockets, we find more
than ten promising compounds for which the self-doping is almost
or even completely suppressed. We derive effective single-band
models for those materials and find that they are in the
strongly correlated regime. We also investigate the possibility
of palladate analogs of high-Tc cuprates. Once synthesized,
these nickelates and palladates will provide a firm ground for
studying superconductivity in the Mott-Hubbard regime of the
Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen classification.},
