 abstract = {Ultrafast vibrational dynamics of inorganic-organic hybrid lead
halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 in the room-temperature tetragonal
phase is investigated under weak photoexcitation at the band
edge. Time-resolved optical Kerr effect signals exhibit periodic
modulations at 4 and 8 THz due to the libration and twisting of
the methylammonium molecule, in addition to the inorganic
sublattice deformation at 1.2 THz. These oscillations are
heavily damped and resemble the short-lived ground-state
oscillation reported in a recent THz-pump study [Z. Liu et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 101, 115125
(2020)2469-995010.1103/PhysRevB.101.115125]. The vibrational
frequencies exhibit blueshifts with increasing pump fluence,
contrary to the expectation from conventional laser heating. Our
ab initio lattice dynamics simulations reveal strongly
anharmonic vibrational potentials for the zone-center optical
phonon modes, and thereby confirm the anharmonicity to be the
origin of the experimentally observed frequency blueshifts.},
