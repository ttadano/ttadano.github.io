abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have superior photoluminescence
  (PL) properties, such as high PL quantum yields and wide PL wavelength tunability,
  for optoelectronic applications. Here, we report the PL spectra of single formamidinium
  lead halide perovskite FAPbX3 (X = Br, I) NCs examined by single-dot spectroscopy
  at low temperature. We found four PL peaks in the low-energy region below the strong
  exciton PL peak that originate from two longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon replicas
  of the exciton PL, biexcitons, and charged excitons (trions). The binding energies
  of the biexcitons and trions become larger as the NCs decrease in size. The LO phonon
  energies show no size dependence, but the Huang--Rhys factors, which reflect the
  strength of the exciton--phonon coupling, become larger for smaller NCs. Our findings
  provide important insights into the exciton properties of perovskite NCs.
