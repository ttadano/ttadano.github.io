abstract: Ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity materials hold great importance since
  they play a critical role in the thermal management of electronic and optical devices.
  Models using machine learning can search for materials with outstanding higher-order
  properties like thermal conductivity. However, the lack of sufficient data to train
  a model is a serious hurdle. Herein we show that big data can complement small data
  for accurate predictions when lower-order feature properties available in big data
  are selected properly and applied to transfer learning. The connection between the
  crystal information and thermal conductivity is directly built with a neural network
  by transferring descriptors acquired through a pretrained model for the feature
  property. Successful transfer learning shows the ability of extrapolative prediction
  and reveals descriptors for lattice anharmonicity. The resulting model is employed
  to screen over 60000 compounds to identify novel crystals that can serve as alternatives
  to diamond. Even though most materials in the top list are superhard materials,
  we reveal that superhard property does not necessarily lead to high lattice thermal
  conductivity. Large hardness means high elastic constants and group velocity of
  phonons in the linear dispersion regime, but the lattice thermal conductivity is
  determined also by other important factors such as the phonon relaxation time. What
  is more, the average or maximum dipole polarizability and the van der Waals radius
  are revealed to be the leading descriptors among those that can also be qualitatively
  related to anharmonicity.
