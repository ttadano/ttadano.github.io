abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have outstanding photoluminescence
  (PL) properties and excellent potential for light-emitting diodes and single-photon
  sources. Here, we report the multiple-peak structures originating from excitons,
  trions, and biexcitons in low-temperature PL spectra of single CsPbBr3 NCs. We found
  fine-structure splitting in the PL peaks of bright excitons and biexcitons and also
  in the longitudinal-optical (LO)-phonon replicas of excitons. LO-phonon replicas
  of trions are clearly observed under strong photoexcitation, which do not show fine-structure
  splitting. From size-dependent analyses of these replicas, we clarified that both
  exciton-phonon and trion-phonon couplings become larger for smaller NCs and the
  coupling strengths of trions are larger than those of excitons in large NCs. These
  behaviors can be explained by the spatial distributions of the electron and hole
  wave functions in the NCs. Our findings provide essential information on electron-phonon
  couplings in perovskites and for the design of high-purity single-photon sources.
