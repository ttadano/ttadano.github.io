abstract: 'Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity in
  the infinite-layer nickelate Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 [Li , Nature (London) 572, 624 (2019)10.1038/s41586-019-1496-5],
  we study how the correlated Ni 3dx2−y2 electrons in the NiO2 layer interact with
  the electrons in the Nd layer. We show that three orbitals are necessary to represent
  the electronic structure around the Fermi level: Ni 3dx2−y2, Nd 5d3z2−r2, and a
  bonding orbital made from an interstitial s orbital in the Nd layer and the Nd 5dxy
  orbital. By constructing a three-orbital model for these states, we find that the
  hybridization between the Ni 3dx2−y2 state and the states in the Nd layer is tiny.
  We also find that the metallic screening by the Nd layer is not so effective in
  that it reduces the Hubbard U between the Ni 3dx2−y2 electrons just by 10%--20%.
  On the other hand, the electron-phonon coupling is not strong enough to mediate
  superconductivity of Tc∼10 K. These results indicate that NdNiO2 hosts an almost
  isolated correlated 3dx2−y2 orbital system. We further study the possibility of
  realizing a more ideal single-orbital system in the Mott-Hubbard regime. We find
  that the Fermi pockets formed by the Nd-layer states dramatically shrink when the
  hybridization between the interstitial s state and Nd 5dxy state becomes small.
  By an extensive materials search, we find that the Fermi pockets almost disappear
  in NaNd2NiO4 and NaCa2NiO3.'
