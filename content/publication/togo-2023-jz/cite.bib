 abstract = {Scientific simulation codes are public property sustained by the
community. Modern technology allows anyone to join scientific
software projects, from anywhere, remotely via the internet. The
phonopy and phono3py codes are widely used open source phonon
calculation codes. This review describes a collection of
computational methods and techniques as implemented in these
codes and shows their implementation strategies as a whole,
aiming to be useful for the community. Some of the techniques
presented here are not limited to phonon calculations and may
therefore be useful in other areas of condensed matter physics.},
