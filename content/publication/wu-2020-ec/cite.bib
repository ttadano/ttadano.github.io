 abstract = {Soft phonon modes in strongly anharmonic crystals are often
neglected in calculations of phonon-related properties. Herein,
we experimentally measure the temperature effects on the band
gap of cubic SrTiO3, and compare with first-principles
calculations by accounting for electron-phonon coupling using
harmonic and anharmonic phonon modes. The harmonic phonon modes
show an increase in the band gap with temperature using either
Allen-Heine-Cardona theory or finite-displacement approach, and
with semilocal or hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. This
finding is in contrast with experimental results that show a
decrease in the band gap with temperature. We show that the
disagreement can be rectified by using anharmonic phonon modes
that modify the contributions not only from the significantly
corrected soft modes, but also from the modes that show little
correction in frequencies. Our results confirm the importance of
soft-phonon modes that are often neglected in the computation of
phonon-related properties and particularly in electron-phonon
coupling.},
