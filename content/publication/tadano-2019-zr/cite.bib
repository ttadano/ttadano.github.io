reserved. The cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition temperature Tc
of SrTiO3 is predicted from first-principles anharmonic lattice
dynamics simulation. By using the self-consistent phonon
approach, we compute finite-temperature phonon dispersion of
cubic and tetragonal SrTiO3. By comparing the Helmholtz free
energies of the two phases calculated with anharmonic effects
included, we obtain Tc3 80 K, which is comparable with the
experimental value of 105 K. In addition, we show that the
nuclear quantum effect is significant for predicting Tc. Our
approach is efficient and provides a convenient way of predicting
the phase stability of solids including ceramics, where the
conventional approach based on the harmonic approximation often
breaks down.},
