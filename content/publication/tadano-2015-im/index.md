abstract: We present an ab initio framework to calculate anharmonic phonon frequency
  and phonon lifetime that is applicable to severely anharmonic systems. We employ
  self-consistent phonon (SCPH) theory with microscopic anharmonic force constants,
  which are extracted from density functional calculations using the least absolute
  shrinkage and selection operator technique. We apply the method to the high-temperature
  phase of SrTiO3 and obtain well-defined phonon quasiparticles that are free from
  imaginary frequencies. Here we show that the anharmonic phonon frequency of the
  antiferrodistortive mode depends significantly on the system size near the critical
  temperature of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition. By applying perturbation
  theory to the SCPH result, phonon lifetimes are calculated for cubic SrTiO3, which
  are then employed to predict lattice thermal conductivity using the Boltzmann transport
  equation within the relaxation-time approximation. The presented methodology is
  efficient and accurate, paving the way toward a reliable description of thermodynamic,
  dynamic, and transport properties of systems with severe anharmonicity, including
  thermoelectric, ferroelectric, and superconducting materials.
