 abstract = {We report the effects of lattice dynamics on the thermodynamic
stability of binary R 1−x Fe x (0 < x < 1) compounds (R:
rare-earth elements, Y, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Dy) at finite
temperature predicted by first-principles calculation based on
density functional theory (DFT). We first demonstrate that the
thermodynamic stability of R 1−x Fe x (0 < x < 1) alloys cannot
be predicted accurately by the conventional approach, where only
the static DFT energy at T = 0 K is used. This issue can be
overcome by considering the entropy contribution, including
electronic and vibrational free energies, and we obtained convex
hull plots at finite temperatures that successfully explain the
thermodynamic stability of various known compounds. Our
systematic calculation indicates that vibrational entropy helps
stabilize various R 1−x Fe x compounds with increasing
temperature. In particular, experimentally reported R 2Fe17
compounds are predicted to become thermodynamically stable above
~ 800 K. We also show that thermodynamic stability is rare-earth
dependent and discuss its origin. Besides the experimentally
reported structures, the stability of two new monoclinic RFe12
structures found by Ishikawa et al. [Phys. Rev. Mater. 4, 104408
(2020)] based on a genetic algorithm are investigated. These
monoclinic phases are found to be dynamically stable and have
larger magnetization than the ThMn12-type RFe12. Although they
are thermodynamically unstable, the formation energies decrease
significantly with increasing temperature, indicating the
possibility of synthesizing these compounds at high
temperatures.},
