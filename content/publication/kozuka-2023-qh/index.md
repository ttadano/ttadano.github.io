abstract: Topological insulators and semimetals are an interesting class of materials
  for new electronic and optical applications owing to their characteristic electromagnetic
  responses originating from the spin-orbit coupled band structures. However, topological
  electronic structures are rare in oxide materials despite their chemical stability
  being preferable for applications. In this study, given the theoretical prediction
  of Dirac bands in CaPd3O4, we investigate the fabrication and transport properties
  of SrPd3O4 and CaPd3O4 thin films as candidates of oxide Dirac semimetals. We have
  found that these materials are epitaxially grown on MgO (100) substrate under limited
  growth conditions by pulsed laser deposition. The transport properties show a weak
  temperature dependence, suggestive of narrow-gap properties, although unintentionally
  doped holes hinder us from revealing the presence of the Dirac band. Our study establishes
  the basic thermodynamics of thin-film fabrication of these materials and will lead
  to interesting properties characteristic of topological band structure by modulating
  the electronic structure by, for example, chemical substitutions or pressure.
