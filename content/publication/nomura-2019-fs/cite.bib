 abstract = {Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of
superconductivity in the infinite-layer nickelate Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2
[Li , Nature (London) 572, 624 (2019)10.1038/s41586-019-1496-5],
we study how the correlated Ni 3dx2−y2 electrons in the NiO2
layer interact with the electrons in the Nd layer. We show that
three orbitals are necessary to represent the electronic
structure around the Fermi level: Ni 3dx2−y2, Nd 5d3z2−r2, and a
bonding orbital made from an interstitial s orbital in the Nd
layer and the Nd 5dxy orbital. By constructing a three-orbital
model for these states, we find that the hybridization between
the Ni 3dx2−y2 state and the states in the Nd layer is tiny. We
also find that the metallic screening by the Nd layer is not so
effective in that it reduces the Hubbard U between the Ni
3dx2−y2 electrons just by 10%--20%. On the other hand, the
electron-phonon coupling is not strong enough to mediate
superconductivity of Tc∼10 K. These results indicate that NdNiO2
hosts an almost isolated correlated 3dx2−y2 orbital system. We
further study the possibility of realizing a more ideal
single-orbital system in the Mott-Hubbard regime. We find that
the Fermi pockets formed by the Nd-layer states dramatically
shrink when the hybridization between the interstitial s state
and Nd 5dxy state becomes small. By an extensive materials
search, we find that the Fermi pockets almost disappear in
NaNd2NiO4 and NaCa2NiO3.},
