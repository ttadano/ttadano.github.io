 abstract = {We present an ab initio framework to calculate anharmonic phonon
frequency and phonon lifetime that is applicable to severely
anharmonic systems. We employ self-consistent phonon (SCPH)
theory with microscopic anharmonic force constants, which are
extracted from density functional calculations using the least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator technique. We apply
the method to the high-temperature phase of SrTiO3 and obtain
well-defined phonon quasiparticles that are free from imaginary
frequencies. Here we show that the anharmonic phonon frequency
of the antiferrodistortive mode depends significantly on the
system size near the critical temperature of the
cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition. By applying perturbation
theory to the SCPH result, phonon lifetimes are calculated for
cubic SrTiO3, which are then employed to predict lattice thermal
conductivity using the Boltzmann transport equation within the
relaxation-time approximation. The presented methodology is
efficient and accurate, paving the way toward a reliable
description of thermodynamic, dynamic, and transport properties
of systems with severe anharmonicity, including thermoelectric,
ferroelectric, and superconducting materials.},
