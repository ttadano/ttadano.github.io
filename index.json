Here, high $ZT$ is demonstrated in toxic-element free Ba$_3$BO (B = Si and Ge) with inverse-perovskite structure. The negatively charged B ion contributes to hole transport with long carrier life time, and their highly dispersive bands with multiple valley degeneracy realize both high p-type electronic conductivity and high Seebeck coefficient, resulting in high power factor (PF). In addition, extremely low lattice thermal conductivities ($\\kappa_l$ ) 1.0-0.4 W m-1 K-1 at T = 300-600 K are observed in Ba3 BO. Highly distorted O-Ba6 octahedral framework with weak ionic bonds between Ba with large mass and O provides low phonon velocities and strong phonon scattering in Ba3 BO. As a consequence of high PF and low $\\kappa_l$, Ba$_3$SiO (Ba$_3$GeO) exhibits rather high ZT = 0.16-0.84 (0.35-0.65) at T = 300-623 K (300-523 K). Finally, based on first-principles carrier and phonon transport calculations, maximum ZT is predicted to be 2.14 for Ba3 SiO and 1.21 for Ba3 GeO at T = 600 K by optimizing hole concentration. Present results propose that inverse-perovskites would be a new platform of environmentally-benign high-ZT thermoelectric materials.","tags":["electronic transport; material design; phonon scattering; semiconductor; thermoelectric material"],"title":"Inverse-Perovskite Ba$_3$BO (B = Si and Ge) as a High Performance Environmentally Benign Thermoelectric Material with Low Lattice Thermal Conductivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusuke Kozuka","Taisuke T Sasaki","Terumasa Tadano","Jun Fujioka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1697587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702186884,"objectID":"45f754d3fe9f0efd603a2e5638d5c358","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/kozuka-2023-qh/","publishdate":"2023-10-18T05:41:24.526369Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kozuka-2023-qh/","section":"publication","summary":"Topological insulators and semimetals are an interesting class of materials for new electronic and optical applications owing to their characteristic electromagnetic responses originating from the spin-orbit coupled band structures. However, topological electronic structures are rare in oxide materials despite their chemical stability being preferable for applications. In this study, given the theoretical prediction of Dirac bands in CaPd3O4, we investigate the fabrication and transport properties of SrPd3O4 and CaPd3O4 thin films as candidates of oxide Dirac semimetals. We have found that these materials are epitaxially grown on MgO (100) substrate under limited growth conditions by pulsed laser deposition. The transport properties show a weak temperature dependence, suggestive of narrow-gap properties, although unintentionally doped holes hinder us from revealing the presence of the Dirac band. Our study establishes the basic thermodynamics of thin-film fabrication of these materials and will lead to interesting properties characteristic of topological band structure by modulating the electronic structure by, for example, chemical substitutions or pressure.","tags":["Palladate","First-principles calculation","Thin film","Transmission electron microscopy","Transport

doping efficiently optimizes the physical properties of Heusler compounds, especially their anomalous transport properties, including anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC). This study systematically investigates the effect of chemical doping on AHC and ANC in 1493 magnetic cubic Heusler compounds using high-throughput first-principles calculations. Notable trends emerge in Co- and Rh-based compounds, where chemical doping effectively enhances the AHC and ANC. Intriguingly, certain doped candidates exhibit outstanding enhancement in AHCs and ANCs, such as (Co$_0.8$Ni$_0.2$)$_2$FeSn with considerable AHC and ANC values of $-2567.78$~S,cm$^-1$ and $8.27$~A,m$^-1$K$^-1$, respectively, and (Rh$_0.8$Ru$_0.2$)$_2$MnIn with an AHC of $1950.49$~S,cm$^-1$. In particular, an extraordinary ANC of $8.57$~A,m$^-1$K$^-1$ is identified exclusively in Rh$_2$Co$_0.7$Fe$_0.3$In, nearly double the maximum value of $4.36$~A,m$^-1$K$^-1$ observed in the stoichiometric Rh$_2$CoIn. A comprehensive band structure analysis underscores that the notable enhancement in ANC arises from the creation and modification of the energy-dependent nodal lines through chemical doping. This mechanism generates a robust Berry curvature, resulting in significant ANCs.

Their magnetic moments, $β$, obtained from the magnetic entropies by separating the spin and lattice vibration terms were 20.09 and 22.71 ($μ$B (compd)-1), respectively, which are consistent with the results of direct magnetization measurements. This indicates that the 3d magnetic moment of Fe, which provides the magnetization, becomes aligned by the effective exchange interaction between Sm 4f via Sm 5d and Fe 3d in a second-order phase transition. In Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti, Co 3d strongly exchange-couples with Fe 3d, following the Slater-Pauling curves, and TC and $β$ simultaneously increase. The Sommerfeld parameters of SmFe11Ti and Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti indicate the inherent valence fluctuation of Sm; that is, the Sm 4f empty density of states was found to be occupied by the electrons surrounding the Sm atom, indicating low phase stability. These findings are expected to contribute to the design of materials with intrinsic magnetic properties.","tags":["Standard entropy; Sommerfeld parameter; Density of states; Magnetic entropy; Magnetic moment; Debye-Einstein spin wave function"],"title":"Magnetic characterization of Sm(Fe1-x, Cox)11Ti (x = 0, 0.1) determined by heat-capacity measurement from very low to high temperatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kouta Kazama","Masato Sakano","Kohei Yamagami","Takuo Ohkochi","Kyoko Ishizaka","Terumasa Tadano","Yusuke Kozuka","Hidetoshi Yoshizawa","Yoshihiro Tsujimoto","Kazunari Yamaura","Jun Fujioka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1690848e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692615592,"objectID":"730bd472d1e5663a2592e2a273097abc","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/kazama-2023-tz/","publishdate":"2023-08-11T10:59:52.492345Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kazama-2023-tz/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Charge transport and thermopower in the electron-doped narrow gap semiconductor Ca$_{1-x}$La$_x$Pd$_3$O$_4$","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryota Masuki","Takuya Nomoto","Ryotaro Arita","Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1690848e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692616873,"objectID":"4df5b47dd48f21bb62fa388790ca948f","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/masuki-2023-zn/","publishdate":"2023-08-21T11:21:13.820006Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masuki-2023-zn/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Japanese","review"],"title":"非調和フォノン理論に基づいた有限温度における結晶構造の第一原理計算","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A paper predicting a structural phase transition in YCo$_5$ has been published from Phys.

This leads to the overdamped limit where the phonon quasi-particle picture can break down. However, this limit is commonly restricted to a narrow temperature range, making it difficult to observe its signature feature, namely the breakdown of the inverse relationship between the relaxation time and damping. Here we present a physically intuitive picture based on the relaxation times of the mode coordinate and its conjugate momentum, which at the instability approach infinity and the inverse damping factor, respectively. We demonstrate this behavior for the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition of the inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3 via molecular dynamics simulations, and show that the overdamped region extends almost 200 K above the transition temperature. Further, we investigate how the dynamics of these soft phonon modes change when crossing the phase transition.","tags":[],"title":"Limits of the phonon quasi-particle picture at the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in halide perovskites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686284100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686284100,"objectID":"e8478e66bef618cc754996d5ddd4cd46","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E3%82%92%E7%94%A8%E3%81%84%E3%81%9F%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E6%B8%A9%E5%BA%A6%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E6%9C%80%E9%81%A9%E5%8C%96/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T13:20:47+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E3%82%92%E7%94%A8%E3%81%84%E3%81%9F%E6%9C%89%E9%99%90%E6%B8%A9%E5%BA%A6%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E6%A7%8B%E9%80%A0%E6%9C%80%E9%81%A9%E5%8C%96/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Japanese","Invited"],"title":"第一原理フォノン計算を用いた有限温度における構造最適化","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A collaboration paper on perovskite solar cell has been published from Chemitry of Materials.

Herein, we introduced formohydrazide (FHZ) as a bidentate ligand into the Sn-halide perovskite (Sn-HaP) to improve the optoelectronic properties. This approach is found to be effective for the suppression of Sn-oxidation and interfacial energy band modulation. The depth profile distribution confirmed that the FHZ additive is primarily located on surfaces and the hole transport layer (HTL)/Sn-HaP interface with partly capping at the grain boundaries, which offers a reducing ambient in the Sn-HaP film. Therefore, the device with FHZ demonstrated a device efficiency of 12.87% (9.93% control) with enhanced open circuit voltage from ∼0.734 to 0.874 V and improved operational device stability. The device analysis suggests that the FHZ additive alleviates the bulk and interface defect in the Sn-PSC with −NH2 and −O═C bidentate bonding to Sn-HaP, which is supported by theoretical calculations. Thus, this work corroborates the importance of multidentate ligands for modulating the film morphology and defect chemistry in the Sn-perovskite for high efficiency and superior device stability.","tags":[],"title":"Alleviating Defect and Oxidation in Tin Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Bidentate Ligand","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chen Shen","Mian Dai","Xingxing Xiao","Niloofar Hadaeghi","Wenjie Xie","Anke Weidenkaff","Terumasa Tadano","Hongbin Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619578,"objectID":"5da1eefded9f060deff45dceb5ae26df","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/shen-2023-ht/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:38.03401Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shen-2023-ht/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate the role of the quartic anharmonicity in the lattice dynamics and thermal transport of the cubic EuTiO3 by combining ab initio self-consistent phonon theory with compressive sensing techniques and experimental thermal conductivity determination measurement.

We find that the strong quartic anharmonicity of oxygen atoms plays an important role in the phonon quasiparticles free from imaginary frequencies in EuTiO3 and causes the hardening of vibrational frequencies of soft modes.

So far, high ZT has been achieved using heavy elements to reduce lattice thermal conductivity (?lat). However, it is not preferred to use such elements because of their environmental load and high material cost. Here a new approach utilizing hydride anion (H?) substitution to oxide ion is proposed for ZT enhancement in thermoelectric oxide SrTiO3 bulk polycrystals. Light element H? substitution largely reduces ?lat from 8.2 W/(mK) of SrTiO3 to 3.5 W/(mK) for SrTiO3?xHx with x = 0.216. The mass difference effect on phonon scattering is small in the SrTiO3?xHx, while local structure distortion arising from the distributed Ti?(O,H) bond lengths strongly enhances phonon scattering. The polycrystalline SrTiO3?xHx shows high electronic conductivity comparable to La-doped SrTiO3 single crystal because the H? substitution does not form a grain boundary potential barrier and thus suppresses electron scattering. As a consequence, SrTiO3?xHx bulk exhibits maximum ZT = 0.11 at room temperature and the ZT value increases continuously up to 0.22 at T = 657 K. The H? substitution idea offers a new approach for ZT enhancement in thermoelectric materials without utilizing heavy elements.","tags":["hydrogen; mixed anion; phonon scattering; thermoelectric materials; transition metal oxides"],"title":"Hydride anion substitution boosts thermoelectric performance of polycrystalline SrTiO $_3$ via simultaneous realization of reduced thermal conductivity and high electronic conductivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomohito Amano","Tamio Yamazaki","Ryosuke Akashi","Terumasa Tadano","Shinji Tsuneyuki"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619582,"objectID":"d1802399cccf85d8c9c18991050ef2a7","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/amano-2023-le/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:42.285982Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amano-2023-le/","section":"publication","summary":"We calculate the lattice dielectric function of strongly anharmonic rutile TiO2 from ab initio anharmonic lattice dynamics methods. Since an accurate calculation of the $Γ$ point phonons is essential for determining optical properties, we employ the modified self-consistent approach, including third-order anharmonicity as well as fourth-order anharmonicity. The resulting optical phonon frequencies and linewidths at the $Γ$ point agree much better with experimental measurements than those from a perturbative approach. We show that the four-phonon scattering process contributes as much as the third-order anharmonic term to phonon linewidths of some phonon modes. Furthermore, incorporating the frequency dependence of phonon linewidth reveals that experimentally known but unidentified peaks of the dielectric function are due to the two-phonon process. This work emphasizes the importance of the self-consistent approach in predicting the optical properties of highly anharmonic materials.","tags":[],"title":"Lattice dielectric properties of rutile TiO$_2$: First-principles anharmonic self-consistent phonon study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhongxu Hu","Mari Hiramatsu","Xinyi He","Takayoshi Katase","Terumasa Tadano","Keisuke Ide","Hidenori Hiramatsu","Hideo Hosono","Toshio Kamiya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619579,"objectID":"9ee1f7f98224801b798effa2db0901ca","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/hu-2023-vt/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:39.871538Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hu-2023-vt/","section":"publication","summary":"We demonstrated a reversible two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) crystal-structure transition and associated thermal conductivity switching ($ąppa$) well above room temperature (RT) in (Sn1--xPbx)S bulk polycrystals, solid solutions of 2D-layered SnS and 3D-cubic PbS. The direct phase boundary between the 2D and 3D structures does not exist in (Sn1--xPbx)S under the thermal equilibrium condition due to the solubility limit x = 0.5 in the 2D phase and x = 0.9 in the 3D phase. While, by applying a non-equilibrium synthesis process that combined a high-temperature solid-state reaction at 973 K and subsequent rapid thermal quenching to RT, the Sn solubility limit in the 3D (Sn1--xPbx)S was not changed but the Pb solubility limit was considerably expanded up to x = 0.9 in 2D (Sn1--xPbx)S. As a result, the direct 2D--3D phase boundary was formed in the Pb-rich (Sn0.2Pb0.8)S, which showed the reversible 2D--3D (3D--2D) structural phase transition at ∼573 K (473 K). This transition temperature is much higher than that previously reported for (Sn0.5Pb0.5)Se, which requires temperatures lower than RT for the reversible structure transition. The electronic band structure change from a 2D semiconducting state to a 3D metallic state caused a 20-times increase in electron $p̨pa$ ($kp̨a$ele) during the structural phase transition in the (Sn0.2Pb0.8)S. Still, $kaą$ele negligibly contributes to the total $kap$̨. In contrast, the lattice $kapp ̨($κąt) was largely decreased by the 3D--2D structure transition due to the formation of a 2D-layered structure with strong phonon scattering, resulting in a 1.8-times modulation of the total $κ$$̨κ$3p̨hase/$κ$2Dh̨ase) at 463 K. The realization of 2D--3D structural phase transition above RT in (Sn1--xPbx)S would accelerate the development of thermal management materials through a crystal-structure dimensionality switch using non-equilibrium phase boundaries.","tags":[],"title":"Reversible Thermal Conductivity Modulation of Non-equilibrium (Sn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$)S by 2D--3D Structural Phase Transition above Room Temperature","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryota Masuki","Takuya Nomoto","Ryotaro Arita","Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619582,"objectID":"78fba0569be6234680789540f4715a93","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/masuki-2022-hv/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:42.055875Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masuki-2022-hv/","section":"publication","summary":"We formulate a first-principle scheme for structural optimization at finite temperature (T) based on the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory, which accurately takes into account the effect of strong phonon anharmonicity.

The 5F-PHZ surface treatment quenches the PbI2 and $δ$-perovskite phase formed in the pristine film. The surface passivation ameliorates the film chemistries at the surface with modulation of interface band alignment as a consequence of halogen bonding with fluoroarene moieties or NH?NH2 terminals. This results in a much longer carrier lifetime with the passivation at the surface and grain boundaries trap centers. As a result, it boosts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (area $≈$ 1 cm2) from 18.10% to 22.29% (VOC $≈$ 1.096?1.178 V) with superior operational thermal stability. A certified PCE of 21.01% with a large area of $≈$1.026 cm2 is also achieved. It is found that the surface passivation forms an interfacial embedded layer subsequent to attenuation of defect densities and suppression of ion migration, which is supported by density-function-theory calculation. Importantly, this approach is effective in enhancing the PCE of narrow and wide bandgap perovskite systems. Thus, this work opens up a new technique for interface modulation with fluoroarene functional derivatives to achieve superior device performance and stability.","tags":[],"title":"Interfacial embedding for high‐efficiency and stable methylammonium‐free perovskite solar cells with fluoroarene hydrazine","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Basini","M Pancaldi","B Wehinger","M Udina","Terumasa Tadano","M C Hoffmann","A V Balatsky","S Bonetti"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619577,"objectID":"bdf0397c9bab5439235b83dc9c03c1d5","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/basini-2022-ii/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:37.581866Z","relpermalink":"/publication/basini-2022-ii/","section":"publication","summary":"The emergence of collective order in matter is among the most fundamental and intriguing phenomena in physics. In recent years, the ultrafast dynamical control and creation of novel ordered states of matter not accessible in thermodynamic equilibrium is receiving much attention. Among those, the theoretical concept of dynamical multiferroicity has been introduced to describe the emergence of magnetization by means of a time-dependent electric polarization in non-ferromagnetic materials. In simple terms, a large amplitude coherent rotating motion of the ions in a crystal induces a magnetic moment along the axis of rotation. However, the experimental verification of this effect is still lacking. Here, we provide evidence of room temperature magnetization in the archetypal paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ due to this mechanism. To achieve it, we resonantly drive the infrared-active soft phonon mode with intense circularly polarized terahertz electric field, and detect a large magneto-optical Kerr effect. A simple model, which includes two coupled nonlinear oscillators whose forces and couplings are derived with ab-initio calculations using self-consistent phonon theory at a finite temperature, reproduces qualitatively our experimental observations on the temporal and frequency domains. A quantitatively correct magnitude of the effect is obtained when one also considers the phonon analogue of the reciprocal of the Einsten - de Haas effect, also called the Barnett effect, where the total angular momentum from the phonon order is transferred to the electronic one. Our findings show a new path for designing ultrafast magnetic switches by means of coherent control of lattice vibrations with light.","tags":[],"title":"Terahertz electric-field driven dynamical multiferroicity in SrTiO$_3$","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusaku Nishimura","Xinyi He","Takayoshi Katase","Terumasa Tadano","Keisuke Ide","Suguru Kitani","Kota Hanzawa","Shigenori Ueda","Hidenori Hiramatsu","Hitoshi Kawaji","Hideo Hosono","Toshio Kamiya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619581,"objectID":"9fe3bb3361aab1da1c7c33ad72b89514","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/nishimura-2022-sj/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:41.355694Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nishimura-2022-sj/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Dynamic control of thermal transport in solid materials is highly desired for thermal management technology.

Harmonic lattice dynamics (HLD) calculations indicate that YCo5 with 56 full valance electrons is dynamically unstable and this instability can be cured by reducing the number of electrons (Ne). Crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis reveals that the observed phonon instability originates from the large population of antibonding states near the Fermi level, which is dominated by the Co atoms in the honeycomb layer. The antibonding state depopulates with decreasing Ne, resulting in stable phonons for hole-doped YCo5 with Ne$łeq$55. We then evaluate the temperature-dependent MCA energy using both HLD and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. For the pristine YCo5, we observe a very weak temperature decay of the MCA energy, indicating a small effect of lattice dynamics. Also, the MCA energies evaluated with AIMD at all target temperatures are larger than that of the static hexagonal lattice at 0 K, which is mainly attributed to the structural distortion driven by soft phonon modes. In the hole-doped YCo5, where the distortion is suppressed, a considerable temperature decay in MCA energy is obtained both in HLD and AIMD methods, showing that lattice dynamics effects on MCA energy are non-negligible.","tags":[],"title":"Lattice dynamics and its effects on magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of pristine and hole-doped YCo$_5$ from first principles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryota Masuki","Takuya Nomoto","Ryotaro Arita","Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619581,"objectID":"c53f95d6aeccd037c69f960d94402d27","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/masuki-2022-oq/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:41.129514Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masuki-2022-oq/","section":"publication","summary":"We formulate a theory of thermal expansion based on the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory, which nonperturbatively considers the anharmonic effect.

This study reports a breaking of the conventional trade-off relation in thermopower (S)-conductivity ($σ$) and demonstrates a 2 orders of magnitude enhancement of power factor (PF) in compressively strained LaTiO3 (LTO) films. By varying substrates and reducing film thickness down to 4 nm, the out-of-plane to the in-plane lattice parameter ratio is controlled from 0.992 (tensile strain) to 1.034 (compressive strain). This tuning induces the electronic structure change from a Mott insulator to a metal and leads to a 103 -fold increase in $σ$ up to 2920 S cm-1 . Concomitantly, the sign of S inverts from positive to negative, and both $σ$ and S increase and break the trade-off relation between them in the n-type region. As a result, the PF (=S2 $σ$) is significantly enhanced to 300 µW m- 1 K-2 , which is 102 times larger than that of bulk LTO. Present results propose epitaxial strain as a means to finely tune strongly correlated TMOs close to their Mott transition, and thus to harness the hidden large thermoelectric PF.","tags":["epitaxial strains; metal-insulator transition; strongly correlated oxide; thermoelectrics; transition metal oxide"],"title":"Breaking of Thermopower-Conductivity Trade-Off in LaTiO$_3$ Film around Mott Insulator to Metal Transition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keisuke Masuda","Terumasa Tadano","Yoshio Miura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619581,"objectID":"5901f8895134cb28014e185516325b4a","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/masuda-2021-ek/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:41.242061Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masuda-2021-ek/","section":"publication","summary":"The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is one of the most important spintronic phenomena but its reduction at finite temperature is a severe drawback for applications.

The effective Hamiltonian is described in terms of the Wannier function in the spinor form, and effective interactions are derived with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA) method. Based on this formalism and the developed code, we derive an effective Hamiltonian of a strong spin-orbit interaction material Ca5Ir3O12. This system consists of three edge-shared IrO6 octahedral chains arranged along the c axis, and the three Ir atoms in the ab plane compose a triangular lattice. For such a complicated structure, we need to set up the Wannier spinor function under the local coordinate system. We found that a density-functional band structure near the Fermi level is formed by local dxy and dyz orbitals. Then, we constructed the ab initio dxy/dyz model. The estimated nearest-neighbor transfer t is close to 0.2 eV, and the cRPA on-site U and neighboring V electronic interactions are found to be 2.4--2.5 eV and 1 eV, respectively. The resulting characteristic correlation strength defined by (U−V)/t is above 7, and thus this material is classified as a strongly correlated electron system. The on-site transfer integral involved in the spin-orbit interaction is 0.2 eV, which is comparable to the on-site exchange integrals ∼0.2 eV, indicating that the spin-orbit-interaction physics would compete with the Hund physics.

Herein we show that big data can complement small data for accurate predictions when lower-order feature properties available in big data are selected properly and applied to transfer learning. The connection between the crystal information and thermal conductivity is directly built with a neural network by transferring descriptors acquired through a pretrained model for the feature property. Successful transfer learning shows the ability of extrapolative prediction and reveals descriptors for lattice anharmonicity. The resulting model is employed to screen over 60000 compounds to identify novel crystals that can serve as alternatives to diamond. Even though most materials in the top list are superhard materials, we reveal that superhard property does not necessarily lead to high lattice thermal conductivity. Large hardness means high elastic constants and group velocity of phonons in the linear dispersion regime, but the lattice thermal conductivity is determined also by other important factors such as the phonon relaxation time. What is more, the average or maximum dipole polarizability and the van der Waals radius are revealed to be the leading descriptors among those that can also be qualitatively related to anharmonicity.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring diamondlike lattice thermal conductivity crystals via feature-based transfer learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kazuma Nakamura","Yoshihide Yoshimoto","Yusuke Nomura","Terumasa Tadano","Mitsuaki Kawamura","Taichi Kosugi","Kazuyoshi Yoshimi","Takahiro Misawa","Yuichi Motoyama"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619578,"objectID":"389aa200cb2f9c7a5245b2b874117b88","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/nakamura-2021-ub/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:38.488124Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakamura-2021-ub/","section":"publication","summary":"RESPACK is a first-principles calculation software for evaluating the interaction parameters of materials and is able to calculate maximally localized Wannier functions, response functions based on the random phase approximation and related optical properties, and frequency-dependent electronic interaction parameters.

The calculated lattice thermal conductivity reproduced a low thermal conductivity, as shown experimentally, owing to the short phonon lifetime due to the incoherent scattering contribution of Cs atoms. The halogen ion dependence on thermal conductivity reveals that CsSnCl3 exhibits an anomalous lattice thermal conductivity that is as low as that of CsSnBr3. This indicates that the lattice dynamics cannot be explained merely in terms of the atomic mass of the compounds. The low thermal conductivity of CsSnCl3 is caused by the exceptionally short phonon lifetime; further, a bonding analysis suggests that covalent bonding contributes significantly to the unusual anharmonicity of CsSnCl3.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of Halogen Ions on the Low Thermal Conductivity of Cesium Halide Perovskite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603676100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603676100,"objectID":"f1dc00fd6b26aab0f2ba013689f10992","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/%E9%AB%98%E5%9C%A7%E4%B8%8B%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%B3%E6%B0%B4%E7%B4%A0%E5%8C%96%E7%89%A9lah_x%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E5%8E%9F%E5%AD%90%E6%A0%B8%E3%81%AE%E9%87%8F%E5%AD%90%E3%82%86%E3%82%89%E3%81%8D%E3%81%A8%E8%B6%85%E4%BC%9D%E5%B0%8E/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:17:54+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/%E9%AB%98%E5%9C%A7%E4%B8%8B%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%B3%E6%B0%B4%E7%B4%A0%E5%8C%96%E7%89%A9lah_x%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8A%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E5%8E%9F%E5%AD%90%E6%A0%B8%E3%81%AE%E9%87%8F%E5%AD%90%E3%82%86%E3%82%89%E3%81%8D%E3%81%A8%E8%B6%85%E4%BC%9D%E5%B0%8E/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Japanese","Invited"],"title":"高圧下ランタン水素化物LaH$_{x}$における原子核の量子ゆらぎと超伝導","type":"event"},{"authors":["Yusuke Nomura","Motoaki Hirayama","Motoharu Kitatani","Terumasa Tadano","Ryotaro Arita"],"categories":["review"],"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619583,"objectID":"1d919486f09e142b85344b9079adf661","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/nomura-2020-px/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:43.183245Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nomura-2020-px/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ニッケル酸化物新超伝導体の発見：現状と展望","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zezhu Zeng","Shasha Li","Terumasa Tadano","Yue Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619583,"objectID":"126601bd44dc60984c933dec73dc3f5c","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/zeng-2020-pe/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:43.523866Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zeng-2020-pe/","section":"publication","summary":"Two-dimensional (2D) InSe, which exhibits high electron mobility and a wide band gap has emerged as a promising material for photoelectric and thermoelectric applications. The inadequate understanding of the lattice thermal conductivity ($ąppa$), however, hampers the advancement of 2D InSe. Herein, by taking into account anharmonicity up to the fourth order and introducing the equibiaxial tensile strain (ϵ), we have performed an in-depth study on the lattice dynamics of 2D InSe. Interestingly, the $p̨pa$ exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of equibiaxial tensile strain, which can be attributed to the changes in acoustic phonon lifetimes. At the $Γ$ point, a blue-shift of the lowest optical mode and a red-shift of the uppermost optical mode are reported for the first time. More strikingly, the blue-shift can be largely suppressed by equibiaxial tensile strain. Further study indicates that the unique transition of the potential energy surface is responsible for the disappearance of the blue-shift. Our work may enlighten the future research on phonon engineering and management of the lattice thermal conductivity of 2D InSe.","tags":[],"title":"Anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport of monolayer InSe under equibiaxial tensile strains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano","Takashi Koretsune","Ryotaro Arita"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619583,"objectID":"b136ef4d98635e2908e4e15f9a2b741c","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/tadano-2020-yq/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:43.638573Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tadano-2020-yq/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"原子核の量子ゆらぎが支える高圧下LaH$_{10}$の高温超伝導","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Takuya Tanimoto","Koichiro Suekuni","Taiki Tanishita","Hidetomo Usui","Terumasa Tadano","Taiga Kamei","Hikaru Saito","Hirotaka Nishiate","Chul Ho Lee","Kazuhiko Kuroki","Michitaka Ohtaki"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619580,"objectID":"5c58a8b6d0236c34e6be8a0b3818aa5d","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/tanimoto-2020-nn/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:40.557552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tanimoto-2020-nn/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Compound semiconductors derived from ZnS (zincblende and wurtzite) with tetrahedral framework structures have functions for various applications. Examples of such materials include Cu--S-based materials with zincblende-derivative structures, which have attracted attention as thermoelectric (TE) materials over the past decade. This study illuminates superior TE performance in polycrystalline samples of enargite Cu$_3$ P$_{1-x}$ Ge$_x$ S$_4$ with a wurtzite-derivative structure. The substitution of Ge for P dopes holes into the top of the valence band composed of Cu-3d and S-3p, whereby its multiband characteristic leads to a high TE power factor. Furthermore, a reduction in the grain size to 50?300 nm can effectively decrease phonon mean free paths, leading to low thermal conductivity. These features result in a dimensionless TE figure of merit ZT of 0.5 at 673 K for the x = 0.2 sample. Environmentally benign and low-cost characteristics of the constituent elements of Cu3PS4, as well as its high-performance thermoelectricity, make it a promising candidate for large-scale TE applications. Furthermore, this finding extends the development field of Cu--S-based TE materials to those with wurtzite-derivative structures.","tags":["compound semiconductor; enargite; sulfide; thermoelectrics; wurtzite"],"title":"Enargite Cu$_3$PS$_4$ : A Cu--S‐based thermoelectric material with a wurtzite‐derivative structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu-Ning Wu","Wissam A Saidi","Jeffrey K Wuenschell","Terumasa Tadano","Paul Ohodnicki","Benjamin Chorpening","Yuhua Duan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619577,"objectID":"958b4fb86972926e1994899f8d5bf75e","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/wu-2020-ec/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:37.808667Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2020-ec/","section":"publication","summary":"Soft phonon modes in strongly anharmonic crystals are often neglected in calculations of phonon-related properties.

Recent theoretical predictions of rare-earth hydrides with hydrogen cages2,3 and the subsequent synthesis of LaH10 with a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 250 kelvin4,5 have placed these materials on the verge of achieving the long-standing goal of room-temperature superconductivity. Electrical and X-ray diffraction measurements have revealed a weakly pressure-dependent Tc for LaH10 between 137 and 218 gigapascals in a structure that has a face-centred cubic arrangement of lanthanum atoms5. Here we show that quantum atomic fluctuations stabilize a highly symmetrical [Formula: see text] crystal structure over this pressure range. The structure is consistent with experimental findings and has a very large electron-phonon coupling constant of 3.5. Although ab initio classical calculations predict that this [Formula: see text] structure undergoes distortion at pressures below 230 gigapascals2,3, yielding a complex energy landscape, the inclusion of quantum effects suggests that it is the true ground-state structure. The agreement between the calculated and experimental Tc values further indicates that this phase is responsible for the superconductivity observed at 250 kelvin. The relevance of quantum fluctuations calls into question many of the crystal structure predictions that have been made for hydrides within a classical approach and that currently guide the experimental quest for room-temperature superconductivity6-8. Furthermore, we find that quantum effects are crucial for the stabilization of solids with high electron-phonon coupling constants that could otherwise be destabilized by the large electron-phonon interaction9, thus reducing the pressures required for their synthesis.","tags":[],"title":"Quantum crystal structure in the 250-kelvin superconducting lanthanum hydride","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619578,"objectID":"fb1fb1b0bb9c178ee2ee861debfa550b","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/2020-lb/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:38.601138Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-lb/","section":"publication","summary":"The first-principles phonon calculation is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting phonon dynamics in solids.

We show that three orbitals are necessary to represent the electronic structure around the Fermi level: Ni 3dx2−y2, Nd 5d3z2−r2, and a bonding orbital made from an interstitial s orbital in the Nd layer and the Nd 5dxy orbital. By constructing a three-orbital model for these states, we find that the hybridization between the Ni 3dx2−y2 state and the states in the Nd layer is tiny. We also find that the metallic screening by the Nd layer is not so effective in that it reduces the Hubbard U between the Ni 3dx2−y2 electrons just by 10%--20%. On the other hand, the electron-phonon coupling is not strong enough to mediate superconductivity of Tc∼10 K. These results indicate that NdNiO2 hosts an almost isolated correlated 3dx2−y2 orbital system. We further study the possibility of realizing a more ideal single-orbital system in the Mott-Hubbard regime. We find that the Fermi pockets formed by the Nd-layer states dramatically shrink when the hybridization between the interstitial s state and Nd 5dxy state becomes small.

We demonstrate that the conventional quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) completely breaks down for ScF3 and the quartic anharmonicity, treated nonperturbatively by the self-consistent phonon theory, is essential to reproduce the observed transition from negative to positive thermal expansivity and the hardening of the R4+ soft mode with heating. In addition, we show that the contribution from the cubic anharmonicity to the vibrational free energy, evaluated by the improved self-consistent phonon theory, is significant and as important as that from the quartic anharmonicity for robust understandings of the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient. The first-principles approach of this study enables us to compute various thermodynamic properties of solids in the thermodynamic limit with the effects of cubic and quartic anharmonicities. Therefore, it is expected to solve many known issues of the QHA-based predictions particularly noticeable at high temperature and in strongly anharmonic materials.","tags":[],"title":"First-principles study of phonon anharmonicity and negative thermal expansion in ScF$_3$","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551077100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551077100,"objectID":"f52a78bc984929125b7885c410c00f37","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E3%81%A8%E7%86%B1%E4%BC%9D%E5%B0%8E%E3%81%AE%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:18:48+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E3%81%A8%E7%86%B1%E4%BC%9D%E5%B0%8E%E3%81%AE%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Japanese","Invited"],"title":"クラスレートのフォノンと熱伝導の第一原理解析","type":"event"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1549847400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549847400,"objectID":"07d9e31dbf43c0af80ad6a5b9a40e7a5","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/efficient-ab-initio-prediction-of-thermal-properties-of-solids-assisted-by-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:18:55+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/efficient-ab-initio-prediction-of-thermal-properties-of-solids-assisted-by-machine-learning/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"Efficient ab initio prediction of thermal properties of solids assisted by machine learning","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

We apply the formalism to copper-oxide high $T_c$ superconductors in an example of the interface between overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and Mott insulating La$_2$CuO$_4$ recently realized experimentally. We show that the parameters of the $E_g$ Hamiltonian derived for the La$_2$CuO$_4$ /La1.55Sr0.45CuO$_4$ superlattice differ considerably from those for the bulk La$_2$CuO$_4$, particularly significant in the partially-screened Coulomb parameters and the level offset between the $d_x^2-y^2$ and $d_z^2$ orbitals, $\\Delta E$. In addition, we investigate the effect of the lattice relaxation on the $E_g$ Hamiltonian by carefully comparing the parameters derived before and after the structure optimization. We find that the CuO$_6$ octahedra distort after the relaxation as a consequence of the Madelung potential difference between the insulator and metal sides, by which the layer dependence of the hopping and Coulomb parameters becomes more gradual than the unrelaxed case. Furthermore, the structure relaxation dramatically changes the $\\Delta E$ value and the occupation number at the interface. This study not only evidences the importance of the ionic relaxation around interfaces but also provides a set of layer-dependent parameters of the $E_g$ Hamiltonian, which is expected to provide further insight into the interfacial superconductivity when solved with low-energy solvers.","tags":[],"title":"$\\textit{Ab initio}$ derivation of effective Hamiltonian for La$_2$CuO$_4$/La$_{1.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$CuO$_4$ heterostructure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano","Shinji Tsuneyuki"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619582,"objectID":"797622d2ad0867a79b92acb5eeea8ba5","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/tadano-2019-zr/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:42.852828Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tadano-2019-zr/","section":"publication","summary":"o̧pyright 2019 The Ceramic Society of Japan.

The microscopic origin of the slight difference in the lattice thermal conductivity of Si-I/II/VIII clathrates is discussed extensively. Our calculations uncover that the impact of phonon group velocity on the lattice thermal conductivity is far from enough to explain the discrepancies in $ąppa$lat of studied Si clathrates and it mainly is a consequence of the shorter lifetimes of the acoustic modes in type-VIII structure. Similarity between phase space for three-phonon anharmonic scattering processes of studied silicon clathrates highlights the influence of three-phonon coupling strength and the further calculation of the frequency-resolved final state spectra re-emphasizes that the subtle differences arise from the stronger three-phonon interaction coefficients.","tags":[],"title":"Thermal conductivity of type-I, type-II, and type-VIII pristine silicon clathrates: A first-principles study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano","Shinji Tsuneyuki"],"categories":["review"],"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619580,"objectID":"323b636d248ce60290e0bc258e433a83","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/tadano-2017-mw/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:40.328193Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tadano-2017-mw/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"第一原理からの非調和フォノンと格子熱伝導","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501480200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501480200,"objectID":"855d6628eebf438854eddb257f470ef7","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E9%9D%9E%E8%AA%BF%E5%92%8C%E6%80%A7%E3%81%AE%E5%8F%96%E3%82%8A%E6%89%B1%E3%81%84/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:24:32+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E9%9D%9E%E8%AA%BF%E5%92%8C%E6%80%A7%E3%81%AE%E5%8F%96%E3%82%8A%E6%89%B1%E3%81%84/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Japanese","Invited"],"title":"第一原理計算でのフォノンの非調和性の取り扱い","type":"event"},{"authors":["Andrew Rohskopf","Hamid R Seyf","Kiarash Gordiz","Terumasa Tadano","Asegun Henry"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619581,"objectID":"12c36cc23df81c0a80ccfd539acf10ce","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/rohskopf-2017-nh/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:41.698944Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rohskopf-2017-nh/","section":"publication","summary":"Molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to study phonons and gain insight, but direct comparisons to experimental data are often difficult, due to a lack of accurate empirical interatomic potentials for different systems. As a result, this issue has become a major barrier to realizing the promise associated with advanced atomistic-level modeling techniques. Here, we present a general method for specifically optimizing empirical interatomic potentials from ab initio inputs for the study of phonon transport properties, thereby resulting in phonon optimized potentials. The method uses a genetic algorithm to directly fit the empirical parameters of the potential to the key properties that determine whether or not the atomic level dynamics and most notably the phonon transport are described properly. A framework has been developed that can optimize the potentials needed to more accurately study phonons using molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations are an indispensable tool for studying how atoms interact. Despite their widespread use, however, it is often difficult to determine the potentials needed to accurately describe the various interactions involved for phonons, which are the excitations that underpin physical properties such as thermal conductivity. An international team of researchers led by professor Asegun Henry from the Georgia Institute of Technology presents an approach, based on a genetic algorithm, that can optimise the empirical interatomic potentials for phonons from first principles inputs, that can be used in classical molecular dynamics simulations. And although they demonstrate this method with semiconducting silicon and germanium, it should be extendable to alloys and disordered systems.","tags":[],"title":"Empirical interatomic potentials optimized for phonon properties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491461100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491461100,"objectID":"979436bb7902184a4cccfac9c5a200fe","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/thermal-conductivity-and-lattice-anharmonicity-from-first-principles-theoretical-developments-and-applications/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:24:43+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/thermal-conductivity-and-lattice-anharmonicity-from-first-principles-theoretical-developments-and-applications/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"Thermal conductivity and lattice anharmonicity from first principles: Theoretical developments and applications","type":"event"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1487813400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487813400,"objectID":"5a437ca1b657e728737847cf80036c11","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/%E9%9D%9E%E8%AA%BF%E5%92%8C%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E7%89%A9%E6%80%A7%E3%81%AE%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E3%83%95%E3%83%AD%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BA%E3%81%A8%E3%83%9E%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%9E%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%81%B8%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%81%9F%E5%8F%96%E3%82%8A%E7%B5%84%E3%81%BF/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:24:51+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/%E9%9D%9E%E8%AA%BF%E5%92%8C%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%8E%E3%83%B3%E7%89%A9%E6%80%A7%E3%81%AE%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E3%83%95%E3%83%AD%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BA%E3%81%A8%E3%83%9E%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%9E%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%81%B8%E5%90%91%E3%81%91%E3%81%9F%E5%8F%96%E3%82%8A%E7%B5%84%E3%81%BF/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Japanese","Invited"],"title":"非調和フォノン物性の第一原理計算：プログラム開発とマテリアルズインフォマティクスへ向けた取り組み","type":"event"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481604600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481604600,"objectID":"3441633dc8e22280cac847e084fb69fc","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/first-principles-modeling-of-phonon-transport-and-lattice-anharmonicity-in-energy-harvesting-materials/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:25:02+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/first-principles-modeling-of-phonon-transport-and-lattice-anharmonicity-in-energy-harvesting-materials/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"First-principles modeling of phonon transport and lattice anharmonicity in energy harvesting materials","type":"event"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477878300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477878300,"objectID":"9af8a459cd4a2ab794c0a08b62af6901","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/talk/thermal-conductivity-and-lattice-anharmonicity-of-materials-from-first-principles-calculations/","publishdate":"2023-06-02T11:25:08+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/thermal-conductivity-and-lattice-anharmonicity-of-materials-from-first-principles-calculations/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":["Invited"],"title":"Thermal conductivity and lattice anharmonicity of materials from first-principles calculations","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Recently, it has been pointed out that the presence of the Van Hove singularities (VHS) around the Fermi level is crucial. However, while there have been quantitative estimates of Tc based on the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, the energy dependence of the density of states (DOS) has been neglected to simplify the Eliashberg equation. In this study, we go beyond the constant DOS approximation and explicitly consider the electronic structure over 40 eV around the Fermi level. In contrast with the previous conventional calculations, this approach with a sufficiently large number of Matsubara frequencies enables us to calculate Tc without introducing the empirical pseudo Coulomb potential. We show that while H3S has much higher Tc than H2S for which the VHS is absent, the constant DOS approximation employed so far seriously overestimates (underestimates) Tc by ∼60 K (∼10 K) for H3S (H2S). We then discuss the impact of the strong electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure with and without the VHS and how it affects the superconductivity. In particular, we focus on (1) the feedback effect in the self-consistent calculation of the self-energy, (2) the effect of the energy shift due to the zero-point motion, and (3) the effect of the changes in the phonon frequencies due to strong anharmonicity. We show that the effect of (1)--(3) on Tc is about 10--30 K for both H3S and H2S. Eventually, Tc is estimated to be 181 K for H3S at 250 GPa and 34 K for H2S at 140 GPa, which explains the pressure dependence of Tc observed in the experiment. In addition, we evaluate the lowest-order vertex correction beyond the Migdal-Eliashberg theory and discuss the validity of the Migdal approximation for sulfur hydrides.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of Van Hove singularities on high-Tc superconductivity in H3S","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Terumasa Tadano","Shinji Tsuneyuki"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685619580,"objectID":"94cf882238214b088d1ffa314bb538ad","permalink":"https://ttadano.github.io/publication/tadano-2015-im/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T11:39:40.444262Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tadano-2015-im/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an ab initio framework to calculate anharmonic phonon frequency and phonon lifetime that is applicable to severely anharmonic systems.

To evaluate the linear extrapolation method employed in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the size dependence in NEMD based on BTE calculations. We observe strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD in Si, which can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths and carrying considerable heat.
