 abstract = {We formulate a method of deriving effective low-energy
Hamiltonian for nonperiodic systems such as interfaces for
strongly correlated electron systems by extending
conventional multi-scale $\textit\ab initio\$ scheme for
correlated electrons (MACE). We apply the formalism to
copper-oxide high $T_\m̊ c\$ superconductors in an
example of the interface between overdoped
La$_\2-x\$Sr$_\x\$CuO$_\4\$ and Mott insulating
La$_\2\$CuO$_\4\$ recently realized experimentally. We
show that the parameters of the $E_g$ Hamiltonian derived
for the
La$_\2\$CuO$_\4\$/La$_\1.55\$Sr$_\0.45\$CuO$_\4\$
superlattice differ considerably from those for the bulk
La$_\2\$CuO$_\4\$, particularly significant in the
partially-screened Coulomb parameters and the level offset
between the $d_\x^\2\-y^\2\\$ and $d_\z^\2\\$
orbitals, $Δ E$. In addition, we investigate the effect
of the lattice relaxation on the $E_g$ Hamiltonian by
carefully comparing the parameters derived before and after
the structure optimization. We find that the CuO$_\6\$
octahedra distort after the relaxation as a consequence of
the Madelung potential difference between the insulator and
metal sides, by which the layer dependence of the hopping
and Coulomb parameters becomes more gradual than the
unrelaxed case. Furthermore, the structure relaxation
dramatically changes the $Δ E$ value and the occupation
number at the interface. This study not only evidences the
importance of the ionic relaxation around interfaces but
also provides a set of layer-dependent parameters of the
$E_g$ Hamiltonian, which is expected to provide further
insight into the interfacial superconductivity when solved
with low-energy solvers.},
