 abstract = {An unusually large thermopower (S) enhancement is induced by
heterostructuring thin films of the strongly correlated electron
oxide LaNiO3. The phonon-drag effect, which is not observed in
bulk LaNiO3, enhances S for thin films compressively strained by
LaAlO3 substrates. By a reduction in the layer thickness down to
three unit cells and subsequent LaAlO3 surface termination, a 10
times S enhancement over the bulk value is observed due to large
phonon drag S (Sg), and the Sg contribution to the total S
occurs over a much wider temperature range up to 220 K. The Sg
enhancement originates from the coupling of lattice vibration to
the d electrons with large effective mass in the compressively
strained ultrathin LaNiO3, and the electron-phonon interaction
is largely enhanced by the phonon leakage from the LaAlO3
substrate and the capping layer. The transition-metal oxide
heterostructures emerge as a new playground to manipulate
electronic and phononic properties in the quest for
high-performance thermoelectrics.},
