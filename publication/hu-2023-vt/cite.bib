 abstract = {We demonstrated a reversible two-dimensional (2D) to
three-dimensional (3D) crystal-structure transition and
associated thermal conductivity switching ($ąppa$) well above
room temperature (RT) in (Sn1--xPbx)S bulk polycrystals, solid
solutions of 2D-layered SnS and 3D-cubic PbS. The direct phase
boundary between the 2D and 3D structures does not exist in
(Sn1--xPbx)S under the thermal equilibrium condition due to the
solubility limit x = 0.5 in the 2D phase and x = 0.9 in the 3D
phase. While, by applying a non-equilibrium synthesis process
that combined a high-temperature solid-state reaction at 973 K
and subsequent rapid thermal quenching to RT, the Sn solubility
limit in the 3D (Sn1--xPbx)S was not changed but the Pb
solubility limit was considerably expanded up to x = 0.9 in 2D
(Sn1--xPbx)S. As a result, the direct 2D--3D phase boundary was
formed in the Pb-rich (Sn0.2Pb0.8)S, which showed the reversible
2D--3D (3D--2D) structural phase transition at ∼573 K (473 K).
This transition temperature is much higher than that previously
reported for (Sn0.5Pb0.5)Se, which requires temperatures lower
than RT for the reversible structure transition. The electronic
band structure change from a 2D semiconducting state to a 3D
metallic state caused a 20-times increase in electron $\p̨pa$
($\kp̨a$ele) during the structural phase transition in the
(Sn0.2Pb0.8)S. Still, $\kaą$ele negligibly contributes to the
total $\kap$̨. In contrast, the lattice $\kapp ̨($κąt)
was largely decreased by the 3D--2D structure transition due to
the formation of a 2D-layered structure with strong phonon
scattering, resulting in a 1.8-times modulation of the total
$κ$$̨κ$3p̨hase/$κ$2Dh̨ase) at 463 K. The
realization of 2D--3D structural phase transition above RT in
(Sn1--xPbx)S would accelerate the development of thermal
management materials through a crystal-structure dimensionality
switch using non-equilibrium phase boundaries.},
