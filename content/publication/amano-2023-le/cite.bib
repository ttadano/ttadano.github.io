 abstract = {We calculate the lattice dielectric function of strongly
anharmonic rutile TiO2 from ab initio anharmonic lattice
dynamics methods. Since an accurate calculation of the $Γ$
point phonons is essential for determining optical properties,
we employ the modified self-consistent approach, including
third-order anharmonicity as well as fourth-order anharmonicity.
The resulting optical phonon frequencies and linewidths at the
$Γ$ point agree much better with experimental measurements
than those from a perturbative approach. We show that the
four-phonon scattering process contributes as much as the
third-order anharmonic term to phonon linewidths of some phonon
modes. Furthermore, incorporating the frequency dependence of
phonon linewidth reveals that experimentally known but
unidentified peaks of the dielectric function are due to the
two-phonon process. This work emphasizes the importance of the
self-consistent approach in predicting the optical properties of
highly anharmonic materials.},
