abstract: The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is one of the most important spintronic
  phenomena but its reduction at finite temperature is a severe drawback for applications.
  Here, we reveal a crucial determinant of the drawback, that is, the s-d exchange
  interaction between conduction s and localized d electrons at interfacial ferromagnetic
  layers. By calculating the temperature dependence of the TMR ratio in Fe/MgO/Fe(001),
  we show that the obtained TMR ratio significantly decreases with increasing temperature
  owing to the spin-flip scattering in the $Δ$1 state induced by the s-d exchange
  interaction. The material dependence of the coupling constant Jsd is also discussed
  on the basis of a nonempirical method.
