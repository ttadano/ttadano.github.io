abstract: Tin-perovskite solar cells (Sn-PSCs) have low energy conversion efficiency
  and stability due to facile oxidation of Sn2+ during precursor solution preparation
  and film growth. Herein, we introduced formohydrazide (FHZ) as a bidentate ligand
  into the Sn-halide perovskite (Sn-HaP) to improve the optoelectronic properties.
  This approach is found to be effective for the suppression of Sn-oxidation and interfacial
  energy band modulation. The depth profile distribution confirmed that the FHZ additive
  is primarily located on surfaces and the hole transport layer (HTL)/Sn-HaP interface
  with partly capping at the grain boundaries, which offers a reducing ambient in
  the Sn-HaP film. Therefore, the device with FHZ demonstrated a device efficiency
  of 12.87% (9.93% control) with enhanced open circuit voltage from ∼0.734 to 0.874
  V and improved operational device stability. The device analysis suggests that the
  FHZ additive alleviates the bulk and interface defect in the Sn-PSC with −NH2 and
  −O═C bidentate bonding to Sn-HaP, which is supported by theoretical calculations.
  Thus, this work corroborates the importance of multidentate ligands for modulating
  the film morphology and defect chemistry in the Sn-perovskite for high efficiency
  and superior device stability.
