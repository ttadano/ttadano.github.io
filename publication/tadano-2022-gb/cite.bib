 abstract = {Understanding and predicting lattice dynamics in strongly
anharmonic crystals is one of the long-standing challenges in
condensed matter physics. Here, we propose a first-principles
method that gives accurate quasiparticle (QP) peaks of the phonon
spectrum with strong anharmonic broadening. On top of the
conventional first-order self-consistent phonon (SC1) dynamical
matrix, the proposed method incorporates frequency
renormalization effects by the bubble self-energy within the QP
approximation. We apply the developed methodology to the strongly
anharmonic $α$-CsPbBr_\3\ that displays phonon
instability within the harmonic approximation in the whole
Brillouin zone. While the SC1 theory significantly underestimates
the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition temperature (T_\̧)
by more than 50%, we show that our approach yields
T_\=̧404-423 K, in excellent agreement with the experimental
value of 403 K. We also demonstrate that an accurate
determination of QP peaks is paramount for quantitative
prediction and elucidation of the phonon linewidth.},
