 abstract = {Introducing artificial strain in epitaxial thin films is an
effective strategy to alter electronic structures of transition
metal oxides (TMOs) and to induce novel phenomena and
functionalities not realized in bulk crystals. This study
reports a breaking of the conventional trade-off relation in
thermopower (S)-conductivity ($σ$) and demonstrates a 2
orders of magnitude enhancement of power factor (PF) in
compressively strained LaTiO3 (LTO) films. By varying substrates
and reducing film thickness down to 4 nm, the out-of-plane to
the in-plane lattice parameter ratio is controlled from 0.992
(tensile strain) to 1.034 (compressive strain). This tuning
induces the electronic structure change from a Mott insulator to
a metal and leads to a 103 -fold increase in $σ$ up to 2920
S cm-1 . Concomitantly, the sign of S inverts from positive to
negative, and both $σ$ and S increase and break the
trade-off relation between them in the n-type region. As a
result, the PF (=S2 $σ$) is significantly enhanced to 300
µW m- 1 K-2 , which is 102 times larger than that of bulk LTO.
Present results propose epitaxial strain as a means to finely
tune strongly correlated TMOs close to their Mott transition,
and thus to harness the hidden large thermoelectric PF.},
