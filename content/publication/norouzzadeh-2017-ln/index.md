abstract: By applying first-principles Peierls-Boltzmann transport calculations, the
  lattice thermal conductivities of type-I, type-II, and type-VIII silicon clathrates
  are investigated. The lattice thermal conductivity, spectral lattice thermal conductivity,
  and lattice thermal conductivity versus mean-free path (MFP) of phonons, relaxation
  times, and the anharmonicity of selected Si clathrates are calculated and compared.
  The microscopic origin of the slight difference in the lattice thermal conductivity
  of Si-I/II/VIII clathrates is discussed extensively. Our calculations uncover that
  the impact of phonon group velocity on the lattice thermal conductivity is far from
  enough to explain the discrepancies in $Ä…ppa$lat of studied Si clathrates and it
  mainly is a consequence of the shorter lifetimes of the acoustic modes in type-VIII
  structure. Similarity between phase space for three-phonon anharmonic scattering
  processes of studied silicon clathrates highlights the influence of three-phonon
  coupling strength and the further calculation of the frequency-resolved final state
  spectra re-emphasizes that the subtle differences arise from the stronger three-phonon
  interaction coefficients.
