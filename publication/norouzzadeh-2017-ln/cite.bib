 abstract = {By applying first-principles Peierls-Boltzmann transport
calculations, the lattice thermal conductivities of type-I,
type-II, and type-VIII silicon clathrates are investigated. The
lattice thermal conductivity, spectral lattice thermal
conductivity, and lattice thermal conductivity versus mean-free
path (MFP) of phonons, relaxation times, and the anharmonicity
of selected Si clathrates are calculated and compared. The
microscopic origin of the slight difference in the lattice
thermal conductivity of Si-I/II/VIII clathrates is discussed
extensively. Our calculations uncover that the impact of phonon
group velocity on the lattice thermal conductivity is far from
enough to explain the discrepancies in $Ä…ppa$lat of studied Si
clathrates and it mainly is a consequence of the shorter
lifetimes of the acoustic modes in type-VIII structure.
Similarity between phase space for three-phonon anharmonic
scattering processes of studied silicon clathrates highlights
the influence of three-phonon coupling strength and the further
calculation of the frequency-resolved final state spectra
re-emphasizes that the subtle differences arise from the
stronger three-phonon interaction coefficients.},
