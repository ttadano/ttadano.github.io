abstract: We investigate the role of rattling guest atoms on the lattice thermal conductivity
  of a type-I clathrate Ba_8Ga_16Ge_30 by first-principles lattice dynamics. Comparing
  phonon properties of filled and empty clathrates, we show that rattlers cause tenfold
  reductions in the relaxation time of phonons by increasing the phonon-phonon scattering
  probability. Contrary to the resonant scattering scenario, the reduction in the
  relaxation time occurs in a wide frequency range, which is crucial for explaining
  the unusually low thermal conductivities of clathrates. We also find that the impact
  of rattlers on the group velocity of phonons is secondary because the flattening
  of phonon dispersion occurs only in a limited phase space in the Brillouin zone.
