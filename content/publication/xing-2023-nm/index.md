abstract: Chemical doping efficiently optimizes the physical properties of Heusler
  compounds, especially their anomalous transport properties, including anomalous
  Hall conductivity (AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC). This study systematically
  investigates the effect of chemical doping on AHC and ANC in 1493 magnetic cubic
  Heusler compounds using high-throughput first-principles calculations. Notable trends
  emerge in Co- and Rh-based compounds, where chemical doping effectively enhances
  the AHC and ANC. Intriguingly, certain doped candidates exhibit outstanding enhancement
  in AHCs and ANCs, such as (Co$_0.8$Ni$_0.2$)$_2$FeSn with considerable AHC and ANC
  values of $-2567.78$~S,cm$^-1$ and $8.27$~A,m$^-1$K$^-1$, respectively, and (Rh$_0.8$Ru$_0.2$)$_2$MnIn
  with an AHC of $1950.49$~S,cm$^-1$. In particular, an extraordinary ANC of $8.57$~A,m$^-1$K$^-1$
  is identified exclusively in Rh$_2$Co$_0.7$Fe$_0.3$In, nearly double the maximum
  value of $4.36$~A,m$^-1$K$^-1$ observed in the stoichiometric Rh$_2$CoIn. A comprehensive
  band structure analysis underscores that the notable enhancement in ANC arises from
  the creation and modification of the energy-dependent nodal lines through chemical
  doping. This mechanism generates a robust Berry curvature, resulting in significant
  ANCs. These findings emphasize the pivotal role of chemical doping in engineering
  high-performance materials, thereby expanding the horizons of transport property
  optimization within Heusler compounds.
