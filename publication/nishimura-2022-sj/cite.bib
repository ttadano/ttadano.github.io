 abstract = {Abstract Dynamic control of thermal transport in solid materials
is highly desired for thermal management technology. However,
the development of a material exhibiting large modulation of
thermal conductivity (?) by external stimuli remains a major
challenge. Here, the large ? modulation is reported by the
reversible 3D to 2D crystal structure transition in a
nonequilibrium solid solution of (Pb1?xSnx)Se, where Pb2+
stabilizes a 3D cubic structure while Sn2+ does a 2D layered
structure. The phase boundary of these phases is induced in
(Pb0.5Sn0.5)Se bulk polycrystals by thermally quenching the
high-temperature solid solution phase. Through the 3D?2D phase
transition, the 1/2.9-times decrease of lattice ? (?lat.) is
achieved by strong phonon scattering in the 2D layered
structure, and the electronic ? (?ele.) is also decreased by 5
orders of magnitude due to the electronic phase transition from
a 3D high conductivity state to a 2D semiconducting state. The
total ? (=?lat. + ?ele.) modulation ratio ?3D phase/?2D phase =
3.6 is attained at 373 K. The present strategy will lead to a
novel concept for designing thermal management materials through
crystal-structure dimensionality switch using nonequilibrium
phase boundaries.},
