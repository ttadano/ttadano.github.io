  abstract  = "The soft modes associated with continuous-order phase
               transitions are associated with strong anharmonicity. This leads
               to the overdamped limit where the phonon quasi-particle picture
               can break down. However, this limit is commonly restricted to a
               narrow temperature range, making it difficult to observe its
               signature feature, namely the breakdown of the inverse
               relationship between the relaxation time and damping. Here we
               present a physically intuitive picture based on the relaxation
               times of the mode coordinate and its conjugate momentum, which
               at the instability approach infinity and the inverse damping
               factor, respectively. We demonstrate this behavior for the
               cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition of the inorganic halide
               perovskite CsPbBr3 via molecular dynamics simulations, and show
               that the overdamped region extends almost 200 K above the
               transition temperature. Further, we investigate how the dynamics
               of these soft phonon modes change when crossing the phase
               transition. The overdamped limit around the structural phase
               transitions in halide perovskites causes the phonon
               quasi-particle description to fail. The authors discuss these
               limits and propose an alternative picture, revealing that the
               overdamped limit extends to way broader temperature ranges,
               contrarily to what is commonly assumed.",
