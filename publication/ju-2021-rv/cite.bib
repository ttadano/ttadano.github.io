 abstract = {Ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity materials hold great
importance since they play a critical role in the thermal
management of electronic and optical devices. Models using
machine learning can search for materials with outstanding
higher-order properties like thermal conductivity. However, the
lack of sufficient data to train a model is a serious hurdle.
Herein we show that big data can complement small data for
accurate predictions when lower-order feature properties
available in big data are selected properly and applied to
transfer learning. The connection between the crystal
information and thermal conductivity is directly built with a
neural network by transferring descriptors acquired through a
pretrained model for the feature property. Successful transfer
learning shows the ability of extrapolative prediction and
reveals descriptors for lattice anharmonicity. The resulting
model is employed to screen over 60000 compounds to identify
novel crystals that can serve as alternatives to diamond. Even
though most materials in the top list are superhard materials,
we reveal that superhard property does not necessarily lead to
high lattice thermal conductivity. Large hardness means high
elastic constants and group velocity of phonons in the linear
dispersion regime, but the lattice thermal conductivity is
determined also by other important factors such as the phonon
relaxation time. What is more, the average or maximum dipole
polarizability and the van der Waals radius are revealed to be
the leading descriptors among those that can also be
qualitatively related to anharmonicity.},
