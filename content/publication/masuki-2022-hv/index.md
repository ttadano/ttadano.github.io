abstract: We formulate a first-principle scheme for structural optimization at finite
  temperature (T) based on the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory, which accurately
  takes into account the effect of strong phonon anharmonicity. The T dependence of
  the shape of the unit cell and internal atomic configuration is determined by minimizing
  the variational free energy in the SCP theory. At each optimization step, the interatomic
  force constants in the new structure are calculated without running additional electronic
  structure calculations, which makes the method dramatically efficient. We demonstrate
  that the thermal expansion of silicon and the three-step structural phase transitions
  in BaTiO3 and its pressure-temperature (p-T) phase diagram are successfully reproduced.
  The present formalism will open the way to the nonempirical prediction of physical
  properties at finite T of materials having a complex structural phase diagram.
