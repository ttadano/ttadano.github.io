abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) InSe, which exhibits high electron mobility and a wide
  band gap has emerged as a promising material for photoelectric and thermoelectric
  applications. The inadequate understanding of the lattice thermal conductivity ($ąppa$),
  however, hampers the advancement of 2D InSe. Herein, by taking into account anharmonicity
  up to the fourth order and introducing the equibiaxial tensile strain (ϵ), we have
  performed an in-depth study on the lattice dynamics of 2D InSe. Interestingly, the
  $p̨pa$ exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of equibiaxial tensile strain,
  which can be attributed to the changes in acoustic phonon lifetimes. At the $Γ$
  point, a blue-shift of the lowest optical mode and a red-shift of the uppermost
  optical mode are reported for the first time. More strikingly, the blue-shift can
  be largely suppressed by equibiaxial tensile strain. Further study indicates that
  the unique transition of the potential energy surface is responsible for the disappearance
  of the blue-shift. Our work may enlighten the future research on phonon engineering
  and management of the lattice thermal conductivity of 2D InSe.
