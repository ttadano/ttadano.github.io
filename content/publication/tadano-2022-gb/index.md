abstract: Understanding and predicting lattice dynamics in strongly anharmonic crystals
  is one of the long-standing challenges in condensed matter physics. Here, we propose
  a first-principles method that gives accurate quasiparticle (QP) peaks of the phonon
  spectrum with strong anharmonic broadening. On top of the conventional first-order
  self-consistent phonon (SC1) dynamical matrix, the proposed method incorporates
  frequency renormalization effects by the bubble self-energy within the QP approximation.
  We apply the developed methodology to the strongly anharmonic $Î±$-CsPbBr_3 that
  displays phonon instability within the harmonic approximation in the whole Brillouin
  zone. While the SC1 theory significantly underestimates the cubic-to-tetragonal
  phase transition temperature ($T_c$) by more than 50%, we show that our approach yields
  $T_c=$404-423 K, in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 403 K. We also
  demonstrate that an accurate determination of QP peaks is paramount for quantitative
  prediction and elucidation of the phonon linewidth.
