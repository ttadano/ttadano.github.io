 abstract = {The first-principles phonon calculation is a powerful tool for
understanding and predicting phonon dynamics in solids. However,
the widely used harmonic approximation breaks down when the
thermal or zero-point amplitude of atomic vibrations becomes
significant. Also, it is unable to handle phonon physics relevant
to the lattice anharmonicity, including lattice thermal
conductivity and the structural phase transition. To overcome
this limitation, in recent years, new ab initio phonon
calculation methods, which can treat anharmonic effects beyond
the quasiharmonic level, have been developed. In this article, we
introduce self-consistent phonon theory that can compute
finite-temperature phonon dispersion as well as many-body
perturbation theory for calculating phonon lifetimes. We
demonstrate the validity and versatility of these methods through
their applications to SrTiO$_3$ and Ba$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$.},
