abstract: We formulate a theory of thermal expansion based on the self-consistent
  phonon (SCP) theory, which nonperturbatively considers the anharmonic effect. We
  show that the Grüneisen formula holds within the SCP theory by replacing the phonon
  frequency by the SCP frequency. By comparing it with the quasiharmonic approximation
  (QHA), we derive explicit formulas of the correction to the QHA result. We show
  that the phonon anharmonicity gives a small correction of O(〈Û4〉/〈Û2〉) to the thermal
  expansion coefficient $α$, where Û2 and Û4 are the harmonic and the quartic terms
  of the potential energy surface. On the other hand, we show that the phonon anharmonicity
  gives two correction terms to the temperature (T)-dependent phonon frequency shift
  which are comparable to the original QHA term. In strongly anharmonic materials
  such as NaCl and MgO, these two correction terms tend to cancel out each other,
  which explains why QHA sometimes gives reasonable values for the T-dependent phonon
  frequency shift while it fails for thermal expansion.
