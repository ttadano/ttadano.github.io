abstract: The microscopic origin of the large negative thermal expansion of cubic
  scandium trifluorides (ScF3) is investigated by performing a set of anharmonic free-energy
  calculations based on density functional theory. We demonstrate that the conventional
  quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) completely breaks down for ScF3 and the quartic
  anharmonicity, treated nonperturbatively by the self-consistent phonon theory, is
  essential to reproduce the observed transition from negative to positive thermal
  expansivity and the hardening of the R4+ soft mode with heating. In addition, we
  show that the contribution from the cubic anharmonicity to the vibrational free
  energy, evaluated by the improved self-consistent phonon theory, is significant
  and as important as that from the quartic anharmonicity for robust understandings
  of the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient. The first-principles
  approach of this study enables us to compute various thermodynamic properties of
  solids in the thermodynamic limit with the effects of cubic and quartic anharmonicities.
  Therefore, it is expected to solve many known issues of the QHA-based predictions
  particularly noticeable at high temperature and in strongly anharmonic materials.
