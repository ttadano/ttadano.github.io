 abstract = {We show a first-principles approach for analyzing anharmonic
properties of lattice vibrations in solids. We firstly extract
harmonic and anharmonic force constants from accurate
first-principles calculations based on the density functional
theory. Using the many-body perturbation theory of phonons, we
then estimate the phonon scattering probability due to
anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions. We show the validity of
the approach by computing the lattice thermal conductivity of
Si, a typical covalent semiconductor, and selected
thermoelectric materials PbTe and Bi2Te3 based on the Boltzmann
transport equation. We also show that the phonon lifetime and
the lattice thermal conductivity of the high-temperature phase
of SrTiO3 can be estimated by employing the perturbation theory
on top of the solution of the self-consistent phonon equation.},
