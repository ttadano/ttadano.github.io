 abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to
study phonons and gain insight, but direct comparisons to
experimental data are often difficult, due to a lack of accurate
empirical interatomic potentials for different systems. As a
result, this issue has become a major barrier to realizing the
promise associated with advanced atomistic-level modeling
techniques. Here, we present a general method for specifically
optimizing empirical interatomic potentials from ab initio
inputs for the study of phonon transport properties, thereby
resulting in phonon optimized potentials. The method uses a
genetic algorithm to directly fit the empirical parameters of
the potential to the key properties that determine whether or
not the atomic level dynamics and most notably the phonon
transport are described properly. A framework has been developed
that can optimize the potentials needed to more accurately study
phonons using molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations
are an indispensable tool for studying how atoms interact.
Despite their widespread use, however, it is often difficult to
determine the potentials needed to accurately describe the
various interactions involved for phonons, which are the
excitations that underpin physical properties such as thermal
conductivity. An international team of researchers led by
professor Asegun Henry from the Georgia Institute of Technology
presents an approach, based on a genetic algorithm, that can
optimise the empirical interatomic potentials for phonons from
first principles inputs, that can be used in classical molecular
dynamics simulations. And although they demonstrate this method
with semiconducting silicon and germanium, it should be
extendable to alloys and disordered systems.},
