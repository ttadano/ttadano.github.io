 abstract = {Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have superior
photoluminescence (PL) properties, such as high PL quantum
yields and wide PL wavelength tunability, for optoelectronic
applications. Here, we report the PL spectra of single
formamidinium lead halide perovskite FAPbX3 (X = Br, I) NCs
examined by single-dot spectroscopy at low temperature. We found
four PL peaks in the low-energy region below the strong exciton
PL peak that originate from two longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon
replicas of the exciton PL, biexcitons, and charged excitons
(trions). The binding energies of the biexcitons and trions
become larger as the NCs decrease in size. The LO phonon
energies show no size dependence, but the Huang--Rhys factors,
which reflect the strength of the exciton--phonon coupling,
become larger for smaller NCs. Our findings provide important
insights into the exciton properties of perovskite NCs.},
