 abstract = {Topological insulators and semimetals are an interesting class
of materials for new electronic and optical applications owing
to their characteristic electromagnetic responses originating
from the spin-orbit coupled band structures. However,
topological electronic structures are rare in oxide materials
despite their chemical stability being preferable for
applications. In this study, given the theoretical prediction of
Dirac bands in CaPd3O4, we investigate the fabrication and
transport properties of SrPd3O4 and CaPd3O4 thin films as
candidates of oxide Dirac semimetals. We have found that these
materials are epitaxially grown on MgO (100) substrate under
limited growth conditions by pulsed laser deposition. The
transport properties show a weak temperature dependence,
suggestive of narrow-gap properties, although unintentionally
doped holes hinder us from revealing the presence of the Dirac
band. Our study establishes the basic thermodynamics of
thin-film fabrication of these materials and will lead to
interesting properties characteristic of topological band
structure by modulating the electronic structure by, for
example, chemical substitutions or pressure.},
