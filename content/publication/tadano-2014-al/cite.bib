 abstract = {A systematic method to calculate anharmonic force constants of
crystals is presented. The method employs the direct-method
approach, where anharmonic force constants are extracted from the
trajectory of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at
high temperature. The method is applied to Si where accurate
cubic and quartic force constants are obtained. We observe that
higher-order correction is crucial to obtain accurate force
constants from the trajectory with large atomic displacements.
The calculated harmonic and anharmonic force constants are, then,
combined with the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods in calculating
the thermal conductivity. The BTE approach successfully predicts
the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk Si, whereas NEMD shows
considerable underestimates. To evaluate the linear extrapolation
method employed in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the
size dependence in NEMD based on BTE calculations. We observe
strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD in Si, which
can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths
and carrying considerable heat. Subsequently, we also apply the
whole method to a thermoelectric material Mg2Si and demonstrate
the reliability of the NEMD method for systems with low thermal
conductivities.},
