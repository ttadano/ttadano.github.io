abstract: A systematic method to calculate anharmonic force constants of crystals
  is presented. The method employs the direct-method approach, where anharmonic force
  constants are extracted from the trajectory of first-principles molecular dynamics
  simulations at high temperature. The method is applied to Si where accurate cubic
  and quartic force constants are obtained. We observe that higher-order correction
  is crucial to obtain accurate force constants from the trajectory with large atomic
  displacements. The calculated harmonic and anharmonic force constants are, then,
  combined with the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and non-equilibrium molecular
  dynamics (NEMD) methods in calculating the thermal conductivity. The BTE approach
  successfully predicts the lattice thermal conductivity of bulk Si, whereas NEMD
  shows considerable underestimates. To evaluate the linear extrapolation method employed
  in NEMD to estimate bulk values, we analyze the size dependence in NEMD based on
  BTE calculations. We observe strong nonlinearity in the size dependence of NEMD
  in Si, which can be ascribed to acoustic phonons having long mean-free-paths and
  carrying considerable heat. Subsequently, we also apply the whole method to a thermoelectric
  material Mg2Si and demonstrate the reliability of the NEMD method for systems with
  low thermal conductivities.
