abstract: Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with state-of-the-art efficiencies
  contain thermally unstable methylammonium (MA). Here, interfacial passivation with
  pentafluorophenylhydrazine (5F-PHZ) to fabricate efficient and stable MA/Br-free
  PSCs is introduced. The 5F-PHZ surface treatment quenches the PbI2 and $δ$-perovskite
  phase formed in the pristine film. The surface passivation ameliorates the film
  chemistries at the surface with modulation of interface band alignment as a consequence
  of halogen bonding with fluoroarene moieties or NH?NH2 terminals. This results in
  a much longer carrier lifetime with the passivation at the surface and grain boundaries
  trap centers. As a result, it boosts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (area
  $≈$ 1 cm2) from 18.10% to 22.29% (VOC $≈$ 1.096?1.178 V) with superior operational
  thermal stability. A certified PCE of 21.01% with a large area of $≈$1.026 cm2 is
  also achieved. It is found that the surface passivation forms an interfacial embedded
  layer subsequent to attenuation of defect densities and suppression of ion migration,
  which is supported by density-function-theory calculation. Importantly, this approach
  is effective in enhancing the PCE of narrow and wide bandgap perovskite systems.
  Thus, this work opens up a new technique for interface modulation with fluoroarene
  functional derivatives to achieve superior device performance and stability.
