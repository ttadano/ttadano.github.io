Ba8Ga16Sn30 induced by the quadruple-well potential of guest
atoms were investigated. Phonon transport including a coherent
interbranch component was analyzed using a
first-principles-based self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory that
gives temperature-dependent harmonic interatomic force constants
and by solving off-diagonal components of group velocity
operator. Experimentally observed thermal conductivities have
been reasonably reproduced by considering both lattice and
electron contributions. Through the analysis with the SCP
theory, we found that hardening of guest modes leads to an
increase in lattice thermal conductivity at frequencies below
those of framework-dominant flat modes (<40cmâˆ’1), which finally
results in the slow decay of the total lattice thermal
conductivity with increasing temperature. Detailed analyses
revealed that the increase in lattice thermal conductivity at
low frequency is attributed to (a) the increase in both group
velocities and lifetimes of phonon modes located at frequencies
below that of the flat guest modes and (b) abnormal increase in
lifetimes of phonon modes located between frequencies of the
flat guest and framework modes with increasing temperature.},
