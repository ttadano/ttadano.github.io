 abstract = {High energy-conversion efficiency (ZT) of thermoelectric
materials has been achieved in heavy metal chalcogenides, but the
use of toxic Pb or Te is an obstacle for wide applications of
thermoelectricity. Here, high ZT is demonstrated in toxic-element
free Ba3 BO (B = Si and Ge) with inverse-perovskite structure.
The negatively charged B ion contributes to hole transport with
long carrier life time, and their highly dispersive bands with
multiple valley degeneracy realize both high p-type electronic
conductivity and high Seebeck coefficient, resulting in high
power factor (PF). In addition, extremely low lattice thermal
conductivities ($ąppa$lat ) 1.0-0.4 W m-1 K-1 at T = 300-600 K
are observed in Ba3 BO. Highly distorted O-Ba6 octahedral
framework with weak ionic bonds between Ba with large mass and O
provides low phonon velocities and strong phonon scattering in
Ba3 BO. As a consequence of high PF and low $\p̨pa$lat , Ba3 SiO
(Ba3 GeO) exhibits rather high ZT = 0.16-0.84 (0.35-0.65) at T =
300-623 K (300-523 K). Finally, based on first-principles carrier
and phonon transport calculations, maximum ZT is predicted to be
2.14 for Ba3 SiO and 1.21 for Ba3 GeO at T = 600 K by optimizing
hole concentration. Present results propose that
inverse-perovskites would be a new platform of
environmentally-benign high-ZT thermoelectric materials.},
