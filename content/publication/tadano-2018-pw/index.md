abstract: We review our recent development of a first-principles lattice dynamics
  method that can treat anharmonic effects nonperturbatively. The method is based
  on the self-consistent phonon theory, and temperature-dependent phonon frequencies
  can be calculated efficiently by incorporating recent numerical techniques to estimate
  anharmonic force constants. The validity of our approach is demonstrated through
  applications to cubic strontium titanate, where overall good agreement with experimental
  data is obtained for phonon frequencies and lattice thermal conductivity. We also
  show the feasibility of highly accurate calculations based on a hybrid exchange?correlation
  functional within the present framework. Our method provides a new way of studying
  lattice dynamics in severely anharmonic materials where the standard harmonic approximation
  and the perturbative approach break down.
