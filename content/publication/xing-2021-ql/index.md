abstract: 'We report the effects of lattice dynamics on the thermodynamic stability
  of binary R 1−x Fe x (0 < x < 1) compounds (R: rare-earth elements, Y, Ce, Nd, Sm,
  and Dy) at finite temperature predicted by first-principles calculation based on
  density functional theory (DFT). We first demonstrate that the thermodynamic stability
  of R 1−x Fe x (0 < x < 1) alloys cannot be predicted accurately by the conventional
  approach, where only the static DFT energy at T = 0 K is used. This issue can be
  overcome by considering the entropy contribution, including electronic and vibrational
  free energies, and we obtained convex hull plots at finite temperatures that successfully
  explain the thermodynamic stability of various known compounds. Our systematic calculation
  indicates that vibrational entropy helps stabilize various R 1−x Fe x compounds
  with increasing temperature. In particular, experimentally reported R 2Fe17 compounds
  are predicted to become thermodynamically stable above ~ 800 K. We also show that
  thermodynamic stability is rare-earth dependent and discuss its origin. Besides
  the experimentally reported structures, the stability of two new monoclinic RFe12
  structures found by Ishikawa et al. [Phys. Rev. Mater. 4, 104408 (2020)] based on
  a genetic algorithm are investigated. These monoclinic phases are found to be dynamically
  stable and have larger magnetization than the ThMn12-type RFe12. Although they are
  thermodynamically unstable, the formation energies decrease significantly with increasing
  temperature, indicating the possibility of synthesizing these compounds at high
  temperatures.'
