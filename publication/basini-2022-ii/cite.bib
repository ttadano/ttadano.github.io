 abstract = {The emergence of collective order in matter is among the
most fundamental and intriguing phenomena in physics. In
recent years, the ultrafast dynamical control and creation
of novel ordered states of matter not accessible in
thermodynamic equilibrium is receiving much attention. Among
those, the theoretical concept of dynamical multiferroicity
has been introduced to describe the emergence of
magnetization by means of a time-dependent electric
polarization in non-ferromagnetic materials. In simple
terms, a large amplitude coherent rotating motion of the
ions in a crystal induces a magnetic moment along the axis
of rotation. However, the experimental verification of this
effect is still lacking. Here, we provide evidence of room
temperature magnetization in the archetypal paraelectric
perovskite SrTiO$_3$ due to this mechanism. To achieve it,
we resonantly drive the infrared-active soft phonon mode
with intense circularly polarized terahertz electric field,
and detect a large magneto-optical Kerr effect. A simple
model, which includes two coupled nonlinear oscillators
whose forces and couplings are derived with ab-initio
calculations using self-consistent phonon theory at a finite
temperature, reproduces qualitatively our experimental
observations on the temporal and frequency domains. A
quantitatively correct magnitude of the effect is obtained
when one also considers the phonon analogue of the
reciprocal of the Einsten - de Haas effect, also called the
Barnett effect, where the total angular momentum from the
phonon order is transferred to the electronic one. Our
findings show a new path for designing ultrafast magnetic
switches by means of coherent control of lattice vibrations
