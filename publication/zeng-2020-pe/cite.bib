 abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) InSe, which exhibits high electron mobility
and a wide band gap has emerged as a promising material for
photoelectric and thermoelectric applications. The inadequate
understanding of the lattice thermal conductivity ($ąppa$),
however, hampers the advancement of 2D InSe. Herein, by taking
into account anharmonicity up to the fourth order and
introducing the equibiaxial tensile strain (ϵ), we have
performed an in-depth study on the lattice dynamics of 2D InSe.
Interestingly, the $\p̨pa$ exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour
as a function of equibiaxial tensile strain, which can be
attributed to the changes in acoustic phonon lifetimes. At the
$Γ$ point, a blue-shift of the lowest optical mode and a
red-shift of the uppermost optical mode are reported for the
first time. More strikingly, the blue-shift can be largely
suppressed by equibiaxial tensile strain. Further study
indicates that the unique transition of the potential energy
surface is responsible for the disappearance of the blue-shift.
Our work may enlighten the future research on phonon engineering
and management of the lattice thermal conductivity of 2D InSe.},
