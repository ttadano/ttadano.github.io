 abstract = {RESPACK is a first-principles calculation software for evaluating
the interaction parameters of materials and is able to calculate
maximally localized Wannier functions, response functions based
on the random phase approximation and related optical properties,
and frequency-dependent electronic interaction parameters.
RESPACK receives its input data from a band-calculation code
using norm-conserving pseudopotentials with plane-wave basis
sets. Automatic generation scripts that convert the
band-structure results to the RESPACK inputs are prepared for
xTAPP and Quantum ESPRESSO. An input file for specifying the
RESPACK calculation conditions is designed pursuing simplicity
and is given in the Fortran namelist format. RESPACK supports
hybrid parallelization using OpenMP and MPI and can treat large
systems including a few hundred atoms in the calculation cell.

GNU General Public Licence v3.0 Programming language: Fortran,
Python External routines: LAPACK, BLAS, MPI Nature of problem: Ab
initio calculations for maximally localized Wannier function,
response function with random-phase approximation, and
matrix-element evaluations of frequency-dependent screened direct
and exchange interactions. With this code, an effective
low-energy model of materials is derived from first principles.
Solution method: Our method is based on ab initio many-body
perturbation calculation and the maximally localized Wannier
function calculation. The program employs the plane-wave basis
set, and evaluations of matrix elements are performed with the
fast Fourier transformation. The generalized tetrahedron method
is used for the Brillouin Zone integral. Additional comments
including restrictions and unusual features: RESPACK supports
xTAPP and Quantum ESPRESSO packages, and automatic generation
scripts for converting the band-calculation results to the
RESPACK inputs are prepared for these software. The current
RESPACK only supports band-calculation codes using
norm-conserving pseudopotentials with plane-wave basis sets.
RESPACK supports hybrid parallelization using OpenMP and MPI to
treat large systems in which a few hundred atoms are contained in
unit cell.},
