 abstract = {The microscopic origin of the large negative thermal expansion
of cubic scandium trifluorides (ScF3) is investigated by
performing a set of anharmonic free-energy calculations based on
density functional theory. We demonstrate that the conventional
quasiharmonic approximation (QHA) completely breaks down for
ScF3 and the quartic anharmonicity, treated nonperturbatively by
the self-consistent phonon theory, is essential to reproduce the
observed transition from negative to positive thermal
expansivity and the hardening of the R4+ soft mode with heating.
In addition, we show that the contribution from the cubic
anharmonicity to the vibrational free energy, evaluated by the
improved self-consistent phonon theory, is significant and as
important as that from the quartic anharmonicity for robust
understandings of the temperature dependence of the thermal
expansion coefficient. The first-principles approach of this
study enables us to compute various thermodynamic properties of
solids in the thermodynamic limit with the effects of cubic and
quartic anharmonicities. Therefore, it is expected to solve many
known issues of the QHA-based predictions particularly
noticeable at high temperature and in strongly anharmonic
materials.},
