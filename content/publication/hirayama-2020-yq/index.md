abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in the Sr-doped layered
  nickelate NdNiO2, we perform a systematic computational materials design of layered
  nickelates that are dynamically stable and whose electronic structure better mimics
  the electronic structure of high-Tc cuprates than NdNiO2. While the Ni 3d orbitals
  are self-doped from the d9 configuration in NdNiO2 and the Nd-layer states form
  Fermi pockets, we find more than ten promising compounds for which the self-doping
  is almost or even completely suppressed. We derive effective single-band models
  for those materials and find that they are in the strongly correlated regime. We
  also investigate the possibility of palladate analogs of high-Tc cuprates. Once
  synthesized, these nickelates and palladates will provide a firm ground for studying
  superconductivity in the Mott-Hubbard regime of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen classification.
