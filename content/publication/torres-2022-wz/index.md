abstract: Machine learning techniques are used to explore the intrinsic origins of
  the hydrodynamic thermal transport and to find new materials interesting for science
  and engineering. The hydrodynamic thermal transport is governed intrinsically by
  the hydrodynamic scale and the thermal conductivity. The correlations between these
  intrinsic properties and harmonic and anharmonic properties, and a large number
  of compositional (290) and structural (1224) descriptors of 131 crystal compound
  materials are obtained, revealing some of the key descriptors that determines the
  magnitude of the intrinsic hydrodynamic effects, most of them related with the phonon
  relaxation times. Then, a trained black-box model is applied to screen more than
  5000 materials. The results identify materials with potential technological applications.
  Understanding the properties correlated to hydrodynamic thermal transport can help
  to find new thermoelectric materials and on the design of new materials to ease
  the heat dissipation in electronic devices.
