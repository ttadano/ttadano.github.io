abstract: Longitudinal-optical (LO) mode phonon branches of KCl and NaCl were measured
  using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) at 300 K and calculated by the first-principles
  phonon calculation with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Spectral
  shapes of the IXS measurements and calculated spectral functions agreed well. We
  analyzed the calculated spectral functions that provide higher resolutions of the
  spectra than the IXS measurements. Due to strong anharmonicity, the spectral functions
  of these phonon branches have several peaks and the LO modes along $Î“$-L paths are
  disconnected.
