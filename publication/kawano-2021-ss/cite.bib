 abstract = {The lattice dynamics of CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) and CsPbI3,
which are low-thermal-conductivity materials, are investigated
using first-principles phonon calculations. Because of the
strong lattice anharmonicity and the accompanying instability of
high-temperature cubic phases, the self-consistent phonon
theory, which can incorporate the effect of lattice
anharmonicity at a mean-field level, is applied in this study.
The calculated lattice thermal conductivity reproduced a low
thermal conductivity, as shown experimentally, owing to the
short phonon lifetime due to the incoherent scattering
contribution of Cs atoms. The halogen ion dependence on thermal
conductivity reveals that CsSnCl3 exhibits an anomalous lattice
thermal conductivity that is as low as that of CsSnBr3. This
indicates that the lattice dynamics cannot be explained merely
in terms of the atomic mass of the compounds. The low thermal
conductivity of CsSnCl3 is caused by the exceptionally short
phonon lifetime; further, a bonding analysis suggests that
covalent bonding contributes significantly to the unusual
anharmonicity of CsSnCl3.},
