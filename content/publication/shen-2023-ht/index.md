abstract: We investigate the role of the quartic anharmonicity in the lattice dynamics
  and thermal transport of the cubic EuTiO3 by combining ab initio self-consistent
  phonon theory with compressive sensing techniques and experimental thermal conductivity
  determination measurement. The antiferromagnetic G-type magnetic structure is used
  to mimic the para-magnetic EuTiO3. We find that the strong quartic anharmonicity
  of oxygen atoms plays an important role in the phonon quasiparticles free from imaginary
  frequencies in EuTiO3 and causes the hardening of vibrational frequencies of soft
  modes. Based on these results, the lattice thermal transport properties are predicted
  through the Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation.
  The hardened modes thereby affect calculated lattice thermal conductivity significantly,
  resulting in an improved agreement with experimental results, including the deviation
  from $ąppa$L ∝ T−1 at high temperatures. The calculated thermal conductivity of
  8.2 W/mK at 300 K matched the experimental value of 6.1 W/mK. When considering the
  boundary scattering, the calculated thermal conductivity is reduced to 6.9 W/mK
  at 300 K, which agrees better with the experiment.
