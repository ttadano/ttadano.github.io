 abstract = {We investigate the role of rattling guest atoms on the lattice
thermal conductivity of a type-I clathrate
Ba_\8\Ga_\16\Ge_\30\ by first-principles lattice
dynamics. Comparing phonon properties of filled and empty
clathrates, we show that rattlers cause tenfold reductions in
the relaxation time of phonons by increasing the phonon-phonon
scattering probability. Contrary to the resonant scattering
scenario, the reduction in the relaxation time occurs in a wide
frequency range, which is crucial for explaining the unusually
low thermal conductivities of clathrates. We also find that the
impact of rattlers on the group velocity of phonons is secondary
because the flattening of phonon dispersion occurs only in a
limited phase space in the Brillouin zone.},
