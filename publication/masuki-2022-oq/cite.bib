 abstract = {We formulate a theory of thermal expansion based on the
self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory, which nonperturbatively
considers the anharmonic effect. We show that the Grüneisen
formula holds within the SCP theory by replacing the phonon
frequency by the SCP frequency. By comparing it with the
quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), we derive explicit formulas
of the correction to the QHA result. We show that the phonon
anharmonicity gives a small correction of O(〈Û4〉/〈Û2〉) to the
thermal expansion coefficient $α$, where Û2 and Û4 are
the harmonic and the quartic terms of the potential energy
surface. On the other hand, we show that the phonon
anharmonicity gives two correction terms to the temperature
(T)-dependent phonon frequency shift which are comparable to the
original QHA term. In strongly anharmonic materials such as NaCl
and MgO, these two correction terms tend to cancel out each
other, which explains why QHA sometimes gives reasonable values
for the T-dependent phonon frequency shift while it fails for
thermal expansion.},
