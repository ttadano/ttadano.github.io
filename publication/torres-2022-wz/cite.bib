 abstract = {Machine learning techniques are used to explore the intrinsic
origins of the hydrodynamic thermal transport and to find new
materials interesting for science and engineering. The
hydrodynamic thermal transport is governed intrinsically by the
hydrodynamic scale and the thermal conductivity. The
correlations between these intrinsic properties and harmonic and
anharmonic properties, and a large number of compositional (290)
and structural (1224) descriptors of 131 crystal compound
materials are obtained, revealing some of the key descriptors
that determines the magnitude of the intrinsic hydrodynamic
effects, most of them related with the phonon relaxation times.
Then, a trained black-box model is applied to screen more than
5000 materials. The results identify materials with potential
technological applications. Understanding the properties
correlated to hydrodynamic thermal transport can help to find
new thermoelectric materials and on the design of new materials
to ease the heat dissipation in electronic devices.},
