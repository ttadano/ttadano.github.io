 abstract = {The thermodynamic and magnetic properties of SmFe11Ti and
Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti, which are candidates for the main
constituents of rare-earth magnets, were investigated by
measuring their heat capacities in the range of 2--1050 K. The
Curie temperatures, TC, of SmFe11Ti and Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti were
found to be 582.9 and 705.0 K, respectively. Their magnetic
moments, $β$, obtained from the magnetic entropies by
separating the spin and lattice vibration terms were 20.09 and
22.71 ($μ$B (compd)-1), respectively, which are consistent with
the results of direct magnetization measurements. This indicates
that the 3d magnetic moment of Fe, which provides the
magnetization, becomes aligned by the effective exchange
interaction between Sm 4f via Sm 5d and Fe 3d in a second-order
phase transition. In Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti, Co 3d strongly
exchange-couples with Fe 3d, following the Slater-Pauling curves,
and TC and $β$ simultaneously increase. The Sommerfeld
parameters of SmFe11Ti and Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti indicate the
inherent valence fluctuation of Sm; that is, the Sm 4f empty
density of states was found to be occupied by the electrons
surrounding the Sm atom, indicating low phase stability. These
findings are expected to contribute to the design of materials
with intrinsic magnetic properties.},
