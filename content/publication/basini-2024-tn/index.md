My experimental collaborators have demonstrated, for the first time, the emergence of magnetization due to time-dependent electric polarization in non-magnetic SrTIO$_3$. I contributed in deriving the parameters of the coupled anharmonic oscillator from first-princpiples self-consistent phonon calculations.
