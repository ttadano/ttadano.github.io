 abstract = {One of the interesting open questions for the
high-transition-temperature (Tc) superconductivity in sulfur
hydrides is why high-pressure phases of H3S have extremely high
Tc's. Recently, it has been pointed out that the presence of the
Van Hove singularities (VHS) around the Fermi level is crucial.
However, while there have been quantitative estimates of Tc
based on the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, the energy dependence of
the density of states (DOS) has been neglected to simplify the
Eliashberg equation. In this study, we go beyond the constant
DOS approximation and explicitly consider the electronic
structure over 40 eV around the Fermi level. In contrast with
the previous conventional calculations, this approach with a
sufficiently large number of Matsubara frequencies enables us to
calculate Tc without introducing the empirical pseudo Coulomb
potential. We show that while H3S has much higher Tc than H2S
for which the VHS is absent, the constant DOS approximation
employed so far seriously overestimates (underestimates) Tc by
∼60 K (∼10 K) for H3S (H2S). We then discuss the impact of the
strong electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure with
and without the VHS and how it affects the superconductivity. In
particular, we focus on (1) the feedback effect in the
self-consistent calculation of the self-energy, (2) the effect
of the energy shift due to the zero-point motion, and (3) the
effect of the changes in the phonon frequencies due to strong
anharmonicity. We show that the effect of (1)--(3) on Tc is
about 10--30 K for both H3S and H2S. Eventually, Tc is estimated
to be 181 K for H3S at 250 GPa and 34 K for H2S at 140 GPa,
which explains the pressure dependence of Tc observed in the
experiment. In addition, we evaluate the lowest-order vertex
correction beyond the Migdal-Eliashberg theory and discuss the
validity of the Migdal approximation for sulfur hydrides.},
