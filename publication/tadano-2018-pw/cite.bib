 abstract = {We review our recent development of a first-principles lattice
dynamics method that can treat anharmonic effects
nonperturbatively. The method is based on the self-consistent
phonon theory, and temperature-dependent phonon frequencies can
be calculated efficiently by incorporating recent numerical
techniques to estimate anharmonic force constants. The validity
of our approach is demonstrated through applications to cubic
strontium titanate, where overall good agreement with
experimental data is obtained for phonon frequencies and lattice
thermal conductivity. We also show the feasibility of highly
accurate calculations based on a hybrid exchange?correlation
functional within the present framework. Our method provides a
new way of studying lattice dynamics in severely anharmonic
materials where the standard harmonic approximation and the
perturbative approach break down.},
