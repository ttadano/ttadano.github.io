 abstract = {We study the lattice dynamics effects on the phase stability and
magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energy of CaCu5-type YCo5 at
finite temperatures using first-principles calculations based on
density functional theory (DFT). Harmonic lattice dynamics (HLD)
calculations indicate that YCo5 with 56 full valance electrons
is dynamically unstable and this instability can be cured by
reducing the number of electrons (Ne). Crystal orbital Hamilton
population analysis reveals that the observed phonon instability
originates from the large population of antibonding states near
the Fermi level, which is dominated by the Co atoms in the
honeycomb layer. The antibonding state depopulates with
decreasing Ne, resulting in stable phonons for hole-doped YCo5
with Ne$Å‚eq$55. We then evaluate the temperature-dependent MCA
energy using both HLD and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
methods. For the pristine YCo5, we observe a very weak
temperature decay of the MCA energy, indicating a small effect
of lattice dynamics. Also, the MCA energies evaluated with AIMD
at all target temperatures are larger than that of the static
hexagonal lattice at 0 K, which is mainly attributed to the
structural distortion driven by soft phonon modes. In the
hole-doped YCo5, where the distortion is suppressed, a
considerable temperature decay in MCA energy is obtained both in
HLD and AIMD methods, showing that lattice dynamics effects on
MCA energy are non-negligible.},
