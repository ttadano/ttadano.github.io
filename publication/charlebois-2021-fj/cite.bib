 abstract = {We present an ab initio derivation method for effective
low-energy Hamiltonians of material with strong spin-orbit
interactions. The effective Hamiltonian is described in terms of
the Wannier function in the spinor form, and effective
interactions are derived with the constrained random phase
approximation (cRPA) method. Based on this formalism and the
developed code, we derive an effective Hamiltonian of a strong
spin-orbit interaction material Ca5Ir3O12. This system consists
of three edge-shared IrO6 octahedral chains arranged along the c
axis, and the three Ir atoms in the ab plane compose a
triangular lattice. For such a complicated structure, we need to
set up the Wannier spinor function under the local coordinate
system. We found that a density-functional band structure near
the Fermi level is formed by local dxy and dyz orbitals. Then,
we constructed the ab initio dxy/dyz model. The estimated
nearest-neighbor transfer t is close to 0.2 eV, and the cRPA
on-site U and neighboring V electronic interactions are found to
be 2.4--2.5 eV and 1 eV, respectively. The resulting
characteristic correlation strength defined by (U−V)/t is above
7, and thus this material is classified as a strongly correlated
electron system. The on-site transfer integral involved in the
spin-orbit interaction is 0.2 eV, which is comparable to the
on-site exchange integrals ∼0.2 eV, indicating that the
spin-orbit-interaction physics would compete with the Hund
physics. Based on these calculated results, we discuss possible
rich ground-state low-energy electronic structures of spin,
charge, and orbitals with competing Hund, spin-orbit, and
strong-correlation physics.},
