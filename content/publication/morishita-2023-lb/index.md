abstract: The thermodynamic and magnetic properties of SmFe11Ti and Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti,
  which are candidates for the main constituents of rare-earth magnets, were investigated
  by measuring their heat capacities in the range of 2--1050 K. The Curie temperatures,
  TC, of SmFe11Ti and Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti were found to be 582.9 and 705.0 K, respectively.
  Their magnetic moments, $β$, obtained from the magnetic entropies by separating
  the spin and lattice vibration terms were 20.09 and 22.71 ($μ$B (compd)-1), respectively,
  which are consistent with the results of direct magnetization measurements. This
  indicates that the 3d magnetic moment of Fe, which provides the magnetization, becomes
  aligned by the effective exchange interaction between Sm 4f via Sm 5d and Fe 3d
  in a second-order phase transition. In Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti, Co 3d strongly exchange-couples
  with Fe 3d, following the Slater-Pauling curves, and TC and $β$ simultaneously increase.
  The Sommerfeld parameters of SmFe11Ti and Sm(Fe0.9Co0.1)11Ti indicate the inherent
  valence fluctuation of Sm; that is, the Sm 4f empty density of states was found
  to be occupied by the electrons surrounding the Sm atom, indicating low phase stability.
  These findings are expected to contribute to the design of materials with intrinsic
  magnetic properties.
