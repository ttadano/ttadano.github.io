abstract: Introducing artificial strain in epitaxial thin films is an effective strategy
  to alter electronic structures of transition metal oxides (TMOs) and to induce novel
  phenomena and functionalities not realized in bulk crystals. This study reports
  a breaking of the conventional trade-off relation in thermopower (S)-conductivity
  ($σ$) and demonstrates a 2 orders of magnitude enhancement of power factor (PF)
  in compressively strained LaTiO3 (LTO) films. By varying substrates and reducing
  film thickness down to 4 nm, the out-of-plane to the in-plane lattice parameter
  ratio is controlled from 0.992 (tensile strain) to 1.034 (compressive strain). This
  tuning induces the electronic structure change from a Mott insulator to a metal
  and leads to a 103 -fold increase in $σ$ up to 2920 S cm-1 . Concomitantly, the
  sign of S inverts from positive to negative, and both $σ$ and S increase and break
  the trade-off relation between them in the n-type region. As a result, the PF (=S2
  $σ$) is significantly enhanced to 300 µW m- 1 K-2 , which is 102 times larger than
  that of bulk LTO. Present results propose epitaxial strain as a means to finely
  tune strongly correlated TMOs close to their Mott transition, and thus to harness
  the hidden large thermoelectric PF.
