 abstract = {We formulate a first-principle scheme for structural
optimization at finite temperature (T) based on the
self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory, which accurately takes into
account the effect of strong phonon anharmonicity. The T
dependence of the shape of the unit cell and internal atomic
configuration is determined by minimizing the variational free
energy in the SCP theory. At each optimization step, the
interatomic force constants in the new structure are calculated
without running additional electronic structure calculations,
which makes the method dramatically efficient. We demonstrate
that the thermal expansion of silicon and the three-step
structural phase transitions in BaTiO3 and its
pressure-temperature (p-T) phase diagram are successfully
reproduced. The present formalism will open the way to the
nonempirical prediction of physical properties at finite T of
materials having a complex structural phase diagram.},
