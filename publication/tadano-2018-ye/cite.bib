 abstract = {We investigate the role of the quartic anharmonicity in the
lattice dynamics and thermal transport of the type-I clathrate
Ba_\8\Ga_\16\Ge_\30\ based on ab initio self-consistent
phonon calculations. We show that the strong quartic
anharmonicity of rattling guest atoms causes the hardening of
vibrational frequencies of low-lying optical modes and thereby
affects calculated lattice thermal conductivities $ąppa$_\L\
significantly, resulting in an improved agreement with
experimental results including the deviation from
$\p̨pa$_\L\∝T^\-1\ at high temperature. Moreover, our
static simulations with various different cell volumes shows a
transition from crystal-like to glasslike $\kp̨a$_\L\ around
20 K. Our analyses suggest that the resonance dip of
$\kaą$_\L\ observed in clathrates with large guest free
spaces is attributed mainly to the strong three-phonon scattering
of acoustic modes along with the presence of higher-frequency
dispersive optical modes.},
