 abstract = {Tin-perovskite solar cells (Sn-PSCs) have low energy conversion
efficiency and stability due to facile oxidation of Sn2+ during
precursor solution preparation and film growth. Herein, we
introduced formohydrazide (FHZ) as a bidentate ligand into the
Sn-halide perovskite (Sn-HaP) to improve the optoelectronic
properties. This approach is found to be effective for the
suppression of Sn-oxidation and interfacial energy band
modulation. The depth profile distribution confirmed that the
FHZ additive is primarily located on surfaces and the hole
transport layer (HTL)/Sn-HaP interface with partly capping at
the grain boundaries, which offers a reducing ambient in the
Sn-HaP film. Therefore, the device with FHZ demonstrated a
device efficiency of 12.87% (9.93% control) with enhanced open
circuit voltage from ~0.734 to 0.874 V and improved operational
device stability. The device analysis suggests that the FHZ
additive alleviates the bulk and interface defect in the Sn-PSC
with −NH2 and −O═C bidentate bonding to Sn-HaP, which is
supported by theoretical calculations. Thus, this work
corroborates the importance of multidentate ligands for
modulating the film morphology and defect chemistry in the
Sn-perovskite for high efficiency and superior device stability.},
