abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations have been extensively used to study phonons
  and gain insight, but direct comparisons to experimental data are often difficult,
  due to a lack of accurate empirical interatomic potentials for different systems.
  As a result, this issue has become a major barrier to realizing the promise associated
  with advanced atomistic-level modeling techniques. Here, we present a general method
  for specifically optimizing empirical interatomic potentials from ab initio inputs
  for the study of phonon transport properties, thereby resulting in phonon optimized
  potentials. The method uses a genetic algorithm to directly fit the empirical parameters
  of the potential to the key properties that determine whether or not the atomic
  level dynamics and most notably the phonon transport are described properly. A framework
  has been developed that can optimize the potentials needed to more accurately study
  phonons using molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations are an indispensable
  tool for studying how atoms interact. Despite their widespread use, however, it
  is often difficult to determine the potentials needed to accurately describe the
  various interactions involved for phonons, which are the excitations that underpin
  physical properties such as thermal conductivity. An international team of researchers
  led by professor Asegun Henry from the Georgia Institute of Technology presents
  an approach, based on a genetic algorithm, that can optimise the empirical interatomic
  potentials for phonons from first principles inputs, that can be used in classical
  molecular dynamics simulations. And although they demonstrate this method with semiconducting
  silicon and germanium, it should be extendable to alloys and disordered systems.
