abstract: Scientific simulation codes are public property sustained by the community.
  Modern technology allows anyone to join scientific software projects, from anywhere,
  remotely via the internet. The phonopy and phono3py codes are widely used open source
  phonon calculation codes. This review describes a collection of computational methods
  and techniques as implemented in these codes and shows their implementation strategies
  as a whole, aiming to be useful for the community. Some of the techniques presented
  here are not limited to phonon calculations and may therefore be useful in other
  areas of condensed matter physics.
