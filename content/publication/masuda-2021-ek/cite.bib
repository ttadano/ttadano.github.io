 abstract = {The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is one of the most important
spintronic phenomena but its reduction at finite temperature is
a severe drawback for applications. Here, we reveal a crucial
determinant of the drawback, that is, the s-d exchange
interaction between conduction s and localized d electrons at
interfacial ferromagnetic layers. By calculating the temperature
dependence of the TMR ratio in Fe/MgO/Fe(001), we show that the
obtained TMR ratio significantly decreases with increasing
temperature owing to the spin-flip scattering in the $Δ$1
state induced by the s-d exchange interaction. The material
dependence of the coupling constant Jsd is also discussed on the
basis of a nonempirical method.},
