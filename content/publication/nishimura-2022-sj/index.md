abstract: Abstract Dynamic control of thermal transport in solid materials is highly
  desired for thermal management technology. However, the development of a material
  exhibiting large modulation of thermal conductivity (?) by external stimuli remains
  a major challenge. Here, the large ? modulation is reported by the reversible 3D
  to 2D crystal structure transition in a nonequilibrium solid solution of (Pb1?xSnx)Se,
  where Pb2+ stabilizes a 3D cubic structure while Sn2+ does a 2D layered structure.
  The phase boundary of these phases is induced in (Pb0.5Sn0.5)Se bulk polycrystals
  by thermally quenching the high-temperature solid solution phase. Through the 3D?2D
  phase transition, the 1/2.9-times decrease of lattice ? (?lat.) is achieved by strong
  phonon scattering in the 2D layered structure, and the electronic ? (?ele.) is also
  decreased by 5 orders of magnitude due to the electronic phase transition from a
  3D high conductivity state to a 2D semiconducting state. The total ? (=?lat. + ?ele.)
  modulation ratio ?3D phase/?2D phase = 3.6 is attained at 373 K. The present strategy
  will lead to a novel concept for designing thermal management materials through
  crystal-structure dimensionality switch using nonequilibrium phase boundaries.
