 abstract = {Abstract Compound semiconductors derived from ZnS (zincblende
and wurtzite) with tetrahedral framework structures have
functions for various applications. Examples of such materials
include Cu?S-based materials with zincblende-derivative
structures, which have attracted attention as thermoelectric
(TE) materials over the past decade. This study illuminates
superior TE performance in polycrystalline samples of enargite
Cu3P1?xGexS4 with a wurtzite-derivative structure. The
substitution of Ge for P dopes holes into the top of the valence
band composed of Cu-3d and S-3p, whereby its multiband
characteristic leads to a high TE power factor. Furthermore, a
reduction in the grain size to 50?300 nm can effectively
decrease phonon mean free paths, leading to low thermal
conductivity. These features result in a dimensionless TE figure
of merit ZT of 0.5 at 673 K for the x = 0.2 sample.
Environmentally benign and low-cost characteristics of the
constituent elements of Cu3PS4, as well as its high-performance
thermoelectricity, make it a promising candidate for large-scale
TE applications. Furthermore, this finding extends the
development field of Cu?S-based TE materials to those with
wurtzite-derivative structures.},
