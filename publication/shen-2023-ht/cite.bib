 abstract = {We investigate the role of the quartic anharmonicity in the
lattice dynamics and thermal transport of the cubic EuTiO3 by
combining ab initio self-consistent phonon theory with
compressive sensing techniques and experimental thermal
conductivity determination measurement. The antiferromagnetic
G-type magnetic structure is used to mimic the para-magnetic
EuTiO3. We find that the strong quartic anharmonicity of oxygen
atoms plays an important role in the phonon quasiparticles free
from imaginary frequencies in EuTiO3 and causes the hardening of
vibrational frequencies of soft modes. Based on these results,
the lattice thermal transport properties are predicted through
the Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time
approximation. The hardened modes thereby affect calculated
lattice thermal conductivity significantly, resulting in an
improved agreement with experimental results, including the
deviation from $ąppa$L ∝ T−1 at high temperatures. The
calculated thermal conductivity of 8.2 W/mK at 300 K matched the
experimental value of 6.1 W/mK. When considering the boundary
scattering, the calculated thermal conductivity is reduced to 6.9
W/mK at 300 K, which agrees better with the experiment.},
