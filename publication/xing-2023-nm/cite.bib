 abstract = {Chemical doping efficiently optimizes the physical
properties of Heusler compounds, especially their anomalous
transport properties, including anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) and anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC). This study
systematically investigates the effect of chemical doping on
AHC and ANC in 1493 magnetic cubic Heusler compounds using
high-throughput first-principles calculations. Notable
trends emerge in Co- and Rh-based compounds, where chemical
doping effectively enhances the AHC and ANC. Intriguingly,
certain doped candidates exhibit outstanding enhancement in
AHCs and ANCs, such as (Co$_\0.8\$Ni$_\0.2\$)$_2$FeSn
with considerable AHC and ANC values of
$-2567.78$~S\,cm$^\-1\$ and
$8.27$~A\,m$^\-1\$K$^\-1\$, respectively,
and (Rh$_\0.8\$Ru$_\0.2\$)$_2$MnIn with an AHC of
$1950.49$~S\,cm$^\-1\$. In particular, an
extraordinary ANC of
$8.57$~A\,m$^\-1\$K$^\-1\$ is identified
exclusively in Rh$_2$Co$_\0.7\$Fe$_\0.3\$In, nearly
double the maximum value of
$4.36$~A\,m$^\-1\$K$^\-1\$ observed in the
stoichiometric Rh$_2$CoIn. A comprehensive band structure
analysis underscores that the notable enhancement in ANC
arises from the creation and modification of the
energy-dependent nodal lines through chemical doping. This
mechanism generates a robust Berry curvature, resulting in
significant ANCs. These findings emphasize the pivotal role
of chemical doping in engineering high-performance
materials, thereby expanding the horizons of transport
property optimization within Heusler compounds.},
