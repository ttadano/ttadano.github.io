abstract: Ultrafast vibrational dynamics of inorganic-organic hybrid lead halide perovskite
  CH3NH3PbI3 in the room-temperature tetragonal phase is investigated under weak photoexcitation
  at the band edge. Time-resolved optical Kerr effect signals exhibit periodic modulations
  at 4 and 8 THz due to the libration and twisting of the methylammonium molecule,
  in addition to the inorganic sublattice deformation at 1.2 THz. These oscillations
  are heavily damped and resemble the short-lived ground-state oscillation reported
  in a recent THz-pump study [Z. Liu et al., Phys. Rev. B 101, 115125 (2020)2469-995010.1103/PhysRevB.101.115125].
  The vibrational frequencies exhibit blueshifts with increasing pump fluence, contrary
  to the expectation from conventional laser heating. Our ab initio lattice dynamics
  simulations reveal strongly anharmonic vibrational potentials for the zone-center
  optical phonon modes, and thereby confirm the anharmonicity to be the origin of
  the experimentally observed frequency blueshifts.
