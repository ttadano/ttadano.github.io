 abstract = {Material properties depend largely on the dimensionality of the
crystal structures and the associated electronic structures. If
the crystal-structure dimensionality can be switched reversibly
in the same material, then a drastic property change may be
controllable. Here, we propose a design route for a direct
three-dimensional (3D) to 2D structural phase transition,
demonstrating an example in (Pb1-x Sn x )Se alloy system, where
Pb2+ and Sn2+ have similar ns2 pseudo-closed shell
configurations, but the former stabilizes the 3D rock-salt-type
structure while the latter a 2D layered structure. However, this
system has no direct phase boundary between these crystal
structures under thermal equilibrium. We succeeded in inducing
the direct 3D-2D structural phase transition in (Pb1-x Sn x )Se
alloy epitaxial films by using a nonequilibrium growth technique.
Reversible giant electronic property change was attained at x ~
0.5 originating in the abrupt band structure switch from gapless
Dirac-like state to semiconducting state.},
