abstract: The soft modes associated with continuous-order phase transitions are commonly
  associated with particularly strong anharmonicity. Here, we show that this can lead
  to overdamped behavior already far above the actual transition temperature using
  molecular dynamics simulations and a machine-learned potential. While in the overdamped
  limit the interpretation of lattice vibrations as phonon quasi-particles with a
  specified frequency and relaxation time becomes physically questionable the mathematical
  description in terms of damped oscillators still holds. A physically more intuitive
  picture can be obtained by considering the relaxation times of the mode coordinate
  and its conjugate momentum, which at the instability approach infinity and the inverse
  damping factor, respectively. We demonstrate this behavior quantitatively for the
  prototypical case of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition of the inorganic halide
  perovskite CsPbBr3, and show that the overdamped region extends almost 200 K (or
  about 60%) above the transition temperature.
