abstract: We propose silver-based oxides with layered perovskite structure as candidates
  of exhibiting intriguing feature of strongly correlated electrons. The compounds
  show unique covalence between Ag d and O p orbitals with the strong electron correlation
  of their antibonding orbital similar to the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors,
  but stronger covalency and slightly smaller correlation strength. We examine $A_2$AgO$_2X_2$
  with $A$ =Sr and Ba and $X$ =F, I and Cl in detail. Among them, Sr$_2$AgO$_2$F$_2$
  has the largest effective onsite Coulomb repulsion and shows an antiferromagnetic
  insulating ground state, which competes with correlated metals. It offers features
  both similar and distinct from the copper oxides, and paves a new route. The possibility
  of superconductivity in doped systems is discussed.
