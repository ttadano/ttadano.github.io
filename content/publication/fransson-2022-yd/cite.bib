 abstract = {The soft modes associated with continuous-order phase
transitions are commonly associated with particularly strong
anharmonicity. Here, we show that this can lead to
overdamped behavior already far above the actual transition
temperature using molecular dynamics simulations and a
machine-learned potential. While in the overdamped limit the
interpretation of lattice vibrations as phonon
quasi-particles with a specified frequency and relaxation
time becomes physically questionable the mathematical
description in terms of damped oscillators still holds. A
physically more intuitive picture can be obtained by
considering the relaxation times of the mode coordinate and
its conjugate momentum, which at the instability approach
infinity and the inverse damping factor, respectively. We
demonstrate this behavior quantitatively for the
prototypical case of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase
transition of the inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3, and
show that the overdamped region extends almost 200 K (or
about 60%) above the transition temperature.},
