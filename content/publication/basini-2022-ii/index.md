abstract: The emergence of collective order in matter is among the most fundamental
  and intriguing phenomena in physics. In recent years, the ultrafast dynamical control
  and creation of novel ordered states of matter not accessible in thermodynamic equilibrium
  is receiving much attention. Among those, the theoretical concept of dynamical multiferroicity
  has been introduced to describe the emergence of magnetization by means of a time-dependent
  electric polarization in non-ferromagnetic materials. In simple terms, a large amplitude
  coherent rotating motion of the ions in a crystal induces a magnetic moment along
  the axis of rotation. However, the experimental verification of this effect is still
  lacking. Here, we provide evidence of room temperature magnetization in the archetypal
  paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ due to this mechanism. To achieve it, we resonantly
  drive the infrared-active soft phonon mode with intense circularly polarized terahertz
  electric field, and detect a large magneto-optical Kerr effect. A simple model,
  which includes two coupled nonlinear oscillators whose forces and couplings are
  derived with ab-initio calculations using self-consistent phonon theory at a finite
  temperature, reproduces qualitatively our experimental observations on the temporal
  and frequency domains. A quantitatively correct magnitude of the effect is obtained
  when one also considers the phonon analogue of the reciprocal of the Einsten - de
  Haas effect, also called the Barnett effect, where the total angular momentum from
  the phonon order is transferred to the electronic one. Our findings show a new path
  for designing ultrafast magnetic switches by means of coherent control of lattice
  vibrations with light.
