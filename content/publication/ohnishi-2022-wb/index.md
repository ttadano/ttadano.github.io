abstract: Effects of strong phonon anharmonicity of a type-I clathrate Ba8Ga16Sn30
  induced by the quadruple-well potential of guest atoms were investigated. Phonon
  transport including a coherent interbranch component was analyzed using a first-principles-based
  self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory that gives temperature-dependent harmonic interatomic
  force constants and by solving off-diagonal components of group velocity operator.
  Experimentally observed thermal conductivities have been reasonably reproduced by
  considering both lattice and electron contributions. Through the analysis with the
  SCP theory, we found that hardening of guest modes leads to an increase in lattice
  thermal conductivity at frequencies below those of framework-dominant flat modes
  (<40cmâˆ’1), which finally results in the slow decay of the total lattice thermal
  conductivity with increasing temperature. Detailed analyses revealed that the increase
  in lattice thermal conductivity at low frequency is attributed to (a) the increase
  in both group velocities and lifetimes of phonon modes located at frequencies below
  that of the flat guest modes and (b) abnormal increase in lifetimes of phonon modes
  located between frequencies of the flat guest and framework modes with increasing
  temperature.
