 abstract = {Abstract Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with state-of-the-art
efficiencies contain thermally unstable methylammonium (MA).
Here, interfacial passivation with pentafluorophenylhydrazine
(5F-PHZ) to fabricate efficient and stable MA/Br-free PSCs is
introduced. The 5F-PHZ surface treatment quenches the PbI2 and
$δ$-perovskite phase formed in the pristine film. The
surface passivation ameliorates the film chemistries at the
surface with modulation of interface band alignment as a
consequence of halogen bonding with fluoroarene moieties or
NH?NH2 terminals. This results in a much longer carrier lifetime
with the passivation at the surface and grain boundaries trap
centers. As a result, it boosts the power conversion efficiency
(PCE) (area $≈$ 1 cm2) from 18.10% to 22.29% (VOC
$≈$ 1.096?1.178 V) with superior operational thermal
stability. A certified PCE of 21.01% with a large area of
$≈$1.026 cm2 is also achieved. It is found that the
surface passivation forms an interfacial embedded layer
subsequent to attenuation of defect densities and suppression of
ion migration, which is supported by density-function-theory
calculation. Importantly, this approach is effective in
enhancing the PCE of narrow and wide bandgap perovskite systems.
Thus, this work opens up a new technique for interface
modulation with fluoroarene functional derivatives to achieve
superior device performance and stability.},
