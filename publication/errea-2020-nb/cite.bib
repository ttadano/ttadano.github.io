 abstract = {The discovery of superconductivity at 200 kelvin in the hydrogen
sulfide system at high pressures1 demonstrated the potential of
hydrogen-rich materials as high-temperature superconductors.
Recent theoretical predictions of rare-earth hydrides with
hydrogen cages2,3 and the subsequent synthesis of LaH10 with a
superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 250 kelvin4,5 have
placed these materials on the verge of achieving the
long-standing goal of room-temperature superconductivity.
Electrical and X-ray diffraction measurements have revealed a
weakly pressure-dependent Tc for LaH10 between 137 and 218
gigapascals in a structure that has a face-centred cubic
arrangement of lanthanum atoms5. Here we show that quantum atomic
fluctuations stabilize a highly symmetrical [Formula: see text]
crystal structure over this pressure range. The structure is
consistent with experimental findings and has a very large
electron-phonon coupling constant of 3.5. Although ab initio
classical calculations predict that this [Formula: see text]
structure undergoes distortion at pressures below 230
gigapascals2,3, yielding a complex energy landscape, the
inclusion of quantum effects suggests that it is the true
ground-state structure. The agreement between the calculated and
experimental Tc values further indicates that this phase is
responsible for the superconductivity observed at 250 kelvin. The
relevance of quantum fluctuations calls into question many of the
crystal structure predictions that have been made for hydrides
within a classical approach and that currently guide the
experimental quest for room-temperature superconductivity6-8.
Furthermore, we find that quantum effects are crucial for the
stabilization of solids with high electron-phonon coupling
constants that could otherwise be destabilized by the large
electron-phonon interaction9, thus reducing the pressures
required for their synthesis.},
