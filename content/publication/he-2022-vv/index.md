abstract: Tin mono-selenide (SnSe) exhibits the world record of thermoelectric conversion
  efficiency ZT in the single crystal form, but the performance of polycrystalline
  SnSe is restricted by low electronic conductivity ($σ$) and high thermal conductivity
  ($ąppa$), compared to those of the single crystal. Here an effective strategy to
  achieve high $σ$ and low $p̨pa$ simultaneously is reported on p-type polycrystalline
  SnSe with isovalent Te ion substitution. The nonequilibrium Sn(Se1- x Tex ) solid
  solution bulks with x up to 0.4 are synthesized by the two-step process composed
  of high-temperature solid-state reaction and rapid thermal quenching. The Te ion
  substitution in SnSe realizes high $σ$ due to the 103 -times increase in hole carrier
  concentration and effectively reduced lattice $kp̨a$ less than one-third at room
  temperature. The large-size Te ion in Sn(Se1- x Tex ) forms weak SnTe bonds, leading
  to the high-density formation of hole-donating Sn vacancies and the reduced phonon
  frequency and enhanced phonon scattering. This result-doping of large-size ions
  beyond the equilibrium limit-proposes a new idea for carrier doping and controlling
  thermal properties to enhance the ZT of polycrystalline SnSe.
