abstract: We formulate a method of deriving effective low-energy Hamiltonian for nonperiodic
  systems such as interfaces for strongly correlated electron systems by extending
  conventional multi-scale $\textit{ab initio}$ scheme for correlated electrons (MACE).
  We apply the formalism to copper-oxide high $T_c$ superconductors in an example
  of the interface between overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and Mott insulating La$_2$CuO$_4$
  recently realized experimentally. We show that the parameters of the $E_g$ Hamiltonian
  derived for the La$_2$CuO$_4$ /La1.55Sr0.45CuO$_4$ superlattice differ considerably
  from those for the bulk La$_2$CuO$_4$, particularly significant in the partially-screened
  Coulomb parameters and the level offset between the $d_x^2-y^2$ and $d_z^2$ orbitals,
  $\Delta E$. In addition, we investigate the effect of the lattice relaxation on the $E_g$
  Hamiltonian by carefully comparing the parameters derived before and after the structure
  optimization. We find that the CuO$_6$ octahedra distort after the relaxation as
  a consequence of the Madelung potential difference between the insulator and metal
  sides, by which the layer dependence of the hopping and Coulomb parameters becomes
  more gradual than the unrelaxed case. Furthermore, the structure relaxation dramatically
  changes the $\Delta E$ value and the occupation number at the interface. This study not
  only evidences the importance of the ionic relaxation around interfaces but also
  provides a set of layer-dependent parameters of the $E_g$ Hamiltonian, which is
  expected to provide further insight into the interfacial superconductivity when
  solved with low-energy solvers.
