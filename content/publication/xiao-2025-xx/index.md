We have identified stable and functional Heusler compounds using a high-throughput computational screening approach that incorporates phonon calculations. By evaluating the thermodynamic and dynamical stability of ternary ordered Heusler compounds, we have discovered ~4,000 compounds that are likely stable. Among them, we have identified over 600 magnetic systems, including 47 candidates of the compensated ferrimagnet. 

The generated DFT results are publicly available at [https://www.nims.go.jp/group/spintheory/database/](https://www.nims.go.jp/group/spintheory/database/).
