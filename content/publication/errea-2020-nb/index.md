abstract: 'The discovery of superconductivity at 200 kelvin in the hydrogen sulfide
  system at high pressures1 demonstrated the potential of hydrogen-rich materials
  as high-temperature superconductors. Recent theoretical predictions of rare-earth
  hydrides with hydrogen cages2,3 and the subsequent synthesis of LaH10 with a superconducting
  critical temperature (Tc) of 250 kelvin4,5 have placed these materials on the verge
  of achieving the long-standing goal of room-temperature superconductivity. Electrical
  and X-ray diffraction measurements have revealed a weakly pressure-dependent Tc
  for LaH10 between 137 and 218 gigapascals in a structure that has a face-centred
  cubic arrangement of lanthanum atoms5. Here we show that quantum atomic fluctuations
  stabilize a highly symmetrical [Formula: see text] crystal structure over this pressure
  range. The structure is consistent with experimental findings and has a very large
  electron-phonon coupling constant of 3.5. Although ab initio classical calculations
  predict that this [Formula: see text] structure undergoes distortion at pressures
  below 230 gigapascals2,3, yielding a complex energy landscape, the inclusion of
  quantum effects suggests that it is the true ground-state structure. The agreement
  between the calculated and experimental Tc values further indicates that this phase
  is responsible for the superconductivity observed at 250 kelvin. The relevance of
  quantum fluctuations calls into question many of the crystal structure predictions
  that have been made for hydrides within a classical approach and that currently
  guide the experimental quest for room-temperature superconductivity6-8. Furthermore,
  we find that quantum effects are crucial for the stabilization of solids with high
  electron-phonon coupling constants that could otherwise be destabilized by the large
  electron-phonon interaction9, thus reducing the pressures required for their synthesis.'
