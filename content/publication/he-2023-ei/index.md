abstract: Abstract The development of environmentally benign thermoelectric materials
  with high energy conversion efficiency (ZT) continues to be a long-standing challenge.
  So far, high ZT has been achieved using heavy elements to reduce lattice thermal
  conductivity (?lat). However, it is not preferred to use such elements because of
  their environmental load and high material cost. Here a new approach utilizing hydride
  anion (H?) substitution to oxide ion is proposed for ZT enhancement in thermoelectric
  oxide SrTiO3 bulk polycrystals. Light element H? substitution largely reduces ?lat
  from 8.2 W/(mK) of SrTiO3 to 3.5 W/(mK) for SrTiO3?xHx with x = 0.216. The mass
  difference effect on phonon scattering is small in the SrTiO3?xHx, while local structure
  distortion arising from the distributed Ti?(O,H) bond lengths strongly enhances
  phonon scattering. The polycrystalline SrTiO3?xHx shows high electronic conductivity
  comparable to La-doped SrTiO3 single crystal because the H? substitution does not
  form a grain boundary potential barrier and thus suppresses electron scattering.
  As a consequence, SrTiO3?xHx bulk exhibits maximum ZT = 0.11 at room temperature
  and the ZT value increases continuously up to 0.22 at T = 657 K. The H? substitution
  idea offers a new approach for ZT enhancement in thermoelectric materials without
  utilizing heavy elements.
