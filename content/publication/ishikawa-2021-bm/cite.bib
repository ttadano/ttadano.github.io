 abstract = {Modern high-performance permanent magnets are made from alloys
of rare earth and transition metal elements, and large
magnetization is achieved in the alloys with a high
concentration of transition metals. We applied an evolutionary
search scheme based on first-principles calculations to the
Y-Co-B system and predicted 37 cobalt-rich compounds with a high
probability of being stable. Focusing on remarkably cobalt-rich
compounds, YCo16 and YCo20, we found that, although they are
metastable phases, the phase stability is increased with an
increase of temperature due to the contribution of vibrational
entropy. The magnetization and Curie temperature are higher by
0.22 T and 204 K in YCo16 and by 0.29 T and 204 K in YCo20 than
those of Y2Co17, which has been well studied as a strong
magnetic compound.},
