abstract: oÌ§pyright 2019 The Ceramic Society of Japan. All rights reserved. The cubic-to-tetragonal
  phase transition temperature Tc of SrTiO3 is predicted from first-principles anharmonic
  lattice dynamics simulation. By using the self-consistent phonon approach, we compute
  finite-temperature phonon dispersion of cubic and tetragonal SrTiO3. By comparing
  the Helmholtz free energies of the two phases calculated with anharmonic effects
  included, we obtain Tc3 80 K, which is comparable with the experimental value of
  105 K. In addition, we show that the nuclear quantum effect is significant for predicting
  Tc. Our approach is efficient and provides a convenient way of predicting the phase
  stability of solids including ceramics, where the conventional approach based on
  the harmonic approximation often breaks down.
