 abstract = {Abstract The development of environmentally benign
thermoelectric materials with high energy conversion efficiency
(ZT) continues to be a long-standing challenge. So far, high ZT
has been achieved using heavy elements to reduce lattice thermal
conductivity (?lat). However, it is not preferred to use such
elements because of their environmental load and high material
cost. Here a new approach utilizing hydride anion (H?)
substitution to oxide ion is proposed for ZT enhancement in
thermoelectric oxide SrTiO3 bulk polycrystals. Light element H?
substitution largely reduces ?lat from 8.2 W/(mK) of SrTiO3 to
3.5 W/(mK) for SrTiO3?xHx with x = 0.216. The mass difference
effect on phonon scattering is small in the SrTiO3?xHx, while
local structure distortion arising from the distributed Ti?(O,H)
bond lengths strongly enhances phonon scattering. The
polycrystalline SrTiO3?xHx shows high electronic conductivity
comparable to La-doped SrTiO3 single crystal because the H?
substitution does not form a grain boundary potential barrier
and thus suppresses electron scattering. As a consequence,
SrTiO3?xHx bulk exhibits maximum ZT = 0.11 at room temperature
and the ZT value increases continuously up to 0.22 at T = 657 K.
The H? substitution idea offers a new approach for ZT
enhancement in thermoelectric materials without utilizing heavy
elements.},
