abstract: We show a first-principles approach for analyzing anharmonic properties
  of lattice vibrations in solids. We firstly extract harmonic and anharmonic force
  constants from accurate first-principles calculations based on the density functional
  theory. Using the many-body perturbation theory of phonons, we then estimate the
  phonon scattering probability due to anharmonic phonon-phonon interactions. We show
  the validity of the approach by computing the lattice thermal conductivity of Si,
  a typical covalent semiconductor, and selected thermoelectric materials PbTe and
  Bi2Te3 based on the Boltzmann transport equation. We also show that the phonon lifetime
  and the lattice thermal conductivity of the high-temperature phase of SrTiO3 can
  be estimated by employing the perturbation theory on top of the solution of the
  self-consistent phonon equation.
