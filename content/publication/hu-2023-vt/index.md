abstract: We demonstrated a reversible two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D)
  crystal-structure transition and associated thermal conductivity switching ($ąppa$)
  well above room temperature (RT) in (Sn1--xPbx)S bulk polycrystals, solid solutions
  of 2D-layered SnS and 3D-cubic PbS. The direct phase boundary between the 2D and
  3D structures does not exist in (Sn1--xPbx)S under the thermal equilibrium condition
  due to the solubility limit x = 0.5 in the 2D phase and x = 0.9 in the 3D phase.
  While, by applying a non-equilibrium synthesis process that combined a high-temperature
  solid-state reaction at 973 K and subsequent rapid thermal quenching to RT, the
  Sn solubility limit in the 3D (Sn1--xPbx)S was not changed but the Pb solubility
  limit was considerably expanded up to x = 0.9 in 2D (Sn1--xPbx)S. As a result, the
  direct 2D--3D phase boundary was formed in the Pb-rich (Sn0.2Pb0.8)S, which showed
  the reversible 2D--3D (3D--2D) structural phase transition at ∼573 K (473 K). This
  transition temperature is much higher than that previously reported for (Sn0.5Pb0.5)Se,
  which requires temperatures lower than RT for the reversible structure transition.
  The electronic band structure change from a 2D semiconducting state to a 3D metallic
  state caused a 20-times increase in electron $p̨pa$ ($kp̨a$ele) during the structural
  phase transition in the (Sn0.2Pb0.8)S. Still, $kaą$ele negligibly contributes to
  the total $kap$̨. In contrast, the lattice $kapp ̨($κąt) was largely decreased by
  the 3D--2D structure transition due to the formation of a 2D-layered structure with
  strong phonon scattering, resulting in a 1.8-times modulation of the total $κ$$̨κ$3p̨hase/$κ$2Dh̨ase)
  at 463 K. The realization of 2D--3D structural phase transition above RT in (Sn1--xPbx)S
  would accelerate the development of thermal management materials through a crystal-structure
  dimensionality switch using non-equilibrium phase boundaries.
