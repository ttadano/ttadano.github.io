abstract: An unusually large thermopower (S) enhancement is induced by heterostructuring
  thin films of the strongly correlated electron oxide LaNiO3. The phonon-drag effect,
  which is not observed in bulk LaNiO3, enhances S for thin films compressively strained
  by LaAlO3 substrates. By a reduction in the layer thickness down to three unit cells
  and subsequent LaAlO3 surface termination, a 10 times S enhancement over the bulk
  value is observed due to large phonon drag S (Sg), and the Sg contribution to the
  total S occurs over a much wider temperature range up to 220 K. The Sg enhancement
  originates from the coupling of lattice vibration to the d electrons with large
  effective mass in the compressively strained ultrathin LaNiO3, and the electron-phonon
  interaction is largely enhanced by the phonon leakage from the LaAlO3 substrate
  and the capping layer. The transition-metal oxide heterostructures emerge as a new
  playground to manipulate electronic and phononic properties in the quest for high-performance
  thermoelectrics.
