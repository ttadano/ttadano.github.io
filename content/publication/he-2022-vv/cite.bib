 abstract = {Tin mono-selenide (SnSe) exhibits the world record of
thermoelectric conversion efficiency ZT in the single crystal
form, but the performance of polycrystalline SnSe is restricted
by low electronic conductivity ($σ$) and high thermal
conductivity ($ąppa$), compared to those of the single
crystal. Here an effective strategy to achieve high $σ$ and
low $\p̨pa$ simultaneously is reported on p-type
polycrystalline SnSe with isovalent Te ion substitution. The
nonequilibrium Sn(Se1- x Tex ) solid solution bulks with x up to
0.4 are synthesized by the two-step process composed of
high-temperature solid-state reaction and rapid thermal
quenching. The Te ion substitution in SnSe realizes high
$σ$ due to the 103 -times increase in hole carrier
concentration and effectively reduced lattice $\kp̨a$ less than
one-third at room temperature. The large-size Te ion in Sn(Se1-
x Tex ) forms weak SnTe bonds, leading to the high-density
formation of hole-donating Sn vacancies and the reduced phonon
frequency and enhanced phonon scattering. This result-doping of
large-size ions beyond the equilibrium limit-proposes a new idea
for carrier doping and controlling thermal properties to enhance
the ZT of polycrystalline SnSe.},
