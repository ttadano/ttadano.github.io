abstract: We present an ab initio derivation method for effective low-energy Hamiltonians
  of material with strong spin-orbit interactions. The effective Hamiltonian is described
  in terms of the Wannier function in the spinor form, and effective interactions
  are derived with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA) method. Based
  on this formalism and the developed code, we derive an effective Hamiltonian of
  a strong spin-orbit interaction material Ca5Ir3O12. This system consists of three
  edge-shared IrO6 octahedral chains arranged along the c axis, and the three Ir atoms
  in the ab plane compose a triangular lattice. For such a complicated structure,
  we need to set up the Wannier spinor function under the local coordinate system.
  We found that a density-functional band structure near the Fermi level is formed
  by local dxy and dyz orbitals. Then, we constructed the ab initio dxy/dyz model.
  The estimated nearest-neighbor transfer t is close to 0.2 eV, and the cRPA on-site
  U and neighboring V electronic interactions are found to be 2.4--2.5 eV and 1 eV,
  respectively. The resulting characteristic correlation strength defined by (U−V)/t
  is above 7, and thus this material is classified as a strongly correlated electron
  system. The on-site transfer integral involved in the spin-orbit interaction is
  0.2 eV, which is comparable to the on-site exchange integrals ∼0.2 eV, indicating
  that the spin-orbit-interaction physics would compete with the Hund physics. Based
  on these calculated results, we discuss possible rich ground-state low-energy electronic
  structures of spin, charge, and orbitals with competing Hund, spin-orbit, and strong-correlation
  physics.
