abstract: Soft phonon modes in strongly anharmonic crystals are often neglected in
  calculations of phonon-related properties. Herein, we experimentally measure the
  temperature effects on the band gap of cubic SrTiO3, and compare with first-principles
  calculations by accounting for electron-phonon coupling using harmonic and anharmonic
  phonon modes. The harmonic phonon modes show an increase in the band gap with temperature
  using either Allen-Heine-Cardona theory or finite-displacement approach, and with
  semilocal or hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. This finding is in contrast
  with experimental results that show a decrease in the band gap with temperature.
  We show that the disagreement can be rectified by using anharmonic phonon modes
  that modify the contributions not only from the significantly corrected soft modes,
  but also from the modes that show little correction in frequencies. Our results
  confirm the importance of soft-phonon modes that are often neglected in the computation
  of phonon-related properties and particularly in electron-phonon coupling.
