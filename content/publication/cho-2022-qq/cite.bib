 abstract = {Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have outstanding
photoluminescence (PL) properties and excellent potential for
light-emitting diodes and single-photon sources. Here, we report
the multiple-peak structures originating from excitons, trions,
and biexcitons in low-temperature PL spectra of single CsPbBr3
NCs. We found fine-structure splitting in the PL peaks of bright
excitons and biexcitons and also in the longitudinal-optical
(LO)-phonon replicas of excitons. LO-phonon replicas of trions
are clearly observed under strong photoexcitation, which do not
show fine-structure splitting. From size-dependent analyses of
these replicas, we clarified that both exciton-phonon and
trion-phonon couplings become larger for smaller NCs and the
coupling strengths of trions are larger than those of excitons
in large NCs. These behaviors can be explained by the spatial
distributions of the electron and hole wave functions in the
NCs. Our findings provide essential information on
electron-phonon couplings in perovskites and for the design of
high-purity single-photon sources.},
