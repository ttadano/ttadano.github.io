abstract: Material properties depend largely on the dimensionality of the crystal
  structures and the associated electronic structures. If the crystal-structure dimensionality
  can be switched reversibly in the same material, then a drastic property change
  may be controllable. Here, we propose a design route for a direct three-dimensional
  (3D) to 2D structural phase transition, demonstrating an example in (Pb1-x Sn x
  )Se alloy system, where Pb2+ and Sn2+ have similar ns2 pseudo-closed shell configurations,
  but the former stabilizes the 3D rock-salt-type structure while the latter a 2D
  layered structure. However, this system has no direct phase boundary between these
  crystal structures under thermal equilibrium. We succeeded in inducing the direct
  3D-2D structural phase transition in (Pb1-x Sn x )Se alloy epitaxial films by using
  a nonequilibrium growth technique. Reversible giant electronic property change was
  attained at x ~ 0.5 originating in the abrupt band structure switch from gapless
  Dirac-like state to semiconducting state.
