abstract: The lattice dynamics of CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) and CsPbI3, which are
  low-thermal-conductivity materials, are investigated using first-principles phonon
  calculations. Because of the strong lattice anharmonicity and the accompanying instability
  of high-temperature cubic phases, the self-consistent phonon theory, which can incorporate
  the effect of lattice anharmonicity at a mean-field level, is applied in this study.
  The calculated lattice thermal conductivity reproduced a low thermal conductivity,
  as shown experimentally, owing to the short phonon lifetime due to the incoherent
  scattering contribution of Cs atoms. The halogen ion dependence on thermal conductivity
  reveals that CsSnCl3 exhibits an anomalous lattice thermal conductivity that is
  as low as that of CsSnBr3. This indicates that the lattice dynamics cannot be explained
  merely in terms of the atomic mass of the compounds. The low thermal conductivity
  of CsSnCl3 is caused by the exceptionally short phonon lifetime; further, a bonding
  analysis suggests that covalent bonding contributes significantly to the unusual
  anharmonicity of CsSnCl3.
