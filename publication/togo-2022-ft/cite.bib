 abstract = {Longitudinal-optical (LO) mode phonon branches of KCl and NaCl
were measured using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) at 300 K
and calculated by the first-principles phonon calculation with
the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Spectral
shapes of the IXS measurements and calculated spectral functions
agreed well. We analyzed the calculated spectral functions that
provide higher resolutions of the spectra than the IXS
measurements. Due to strong anharmonicity, the spectral
functions of these phonon branches have several peaks and the LO
modes along $Î“$-L paths are disconnected.},
