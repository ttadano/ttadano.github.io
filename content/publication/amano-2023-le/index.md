abstract: We calculate the lattice dielectric function of strongly anharmonic rutile
  TiO2 from ab initio anharmonic lattice dynamics methods. Since an accurate calculation
  of the $Γ$ point phonons is essential for determining optical properties, we employ
  the modified self-consistent approach, including third-order anharmonicity as well
  as fourth-order anharmonicity. The resulting optical phonon frequencies and linewidths
  at the $Γ$ point agree much better with experimental measurements than those from
  a perturbative approach. We show that the four-phonon scattering process contributes
  as much as the third-order anharmonic term to phonon linewidths of some phonon modes.
  Furthermore, incorporating the frequency dependence of phonon linewidth reveals
  that experimentally known but unidentified peaks of the dielectric function are
  due to the two-phonon process. This work emphasizes the importance of the self-consistent
  approach in predicting the optical properties of highly anharmonic materials.
